"""Inbound handler registry + the ``@webhook_handler`` decorator.

Self-registering, same shape as the scheduler's ``@scheduled`` and MCP's
``@tool``: decorate a function with a slug and it's discoverable at dispatch time.
Handlers live in each app's ``webhook_handlers.py`` (autodiscovered by the same
helper the CRUDView/MCP registries use).

    @webhook_handler("stripe-events")
    def on_stripe(receipt):
        payload = receipt.json()      # parsed body (or None)
        ...                           # create/update records via normal ORM

The handler runs inside ``dispatch_incoming`` (a background task), so it may do
real work; raising marks the WebhookReceipt FAILED without crashing the worker.
