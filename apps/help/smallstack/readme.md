# Django SmallStack

*A minimal Django stack for building and deploying admin-style apps.*

A modern, batteries-included Django starter project built on Django's powerful admin foundation. Production-ready with SQLite, Docker, and zero-downtime Kamal deployment. Clone it, customize it, ship it.

SmallStack is not a theme you have to implement — it's a production-ready system with clear patterns for you to extend with your own ideas and creativity. You focus on what makes your app unique, and SmallStack handles the platform.

## Features

### Profile App
Complete user profile management with photo uploads, cover images, bio, location, and customizable display names. Extend it with your own fields.

### Help System
Built-in documentation system with markdown support, table of contents, search, and easy-to-edit content files. Perfect for user guides or internal docs.

### Background Tasks
Django 6's new Tasks framework is pre-configured with database backend. Send emails, process data, and run jobs in the background effortlessly.

### Theming
Beautiful light and dark modes with CSS custom properties. Customize colors, shadows, and spacing from a single file. User preferences are saved.

### Authentication
Custom User model ready for email login. Password reset flows, secure sessions, and extensible auth patterns built on Django's proven foundation.

### Docker Ready
Production-ready Docker configuration with multi-service compose, health checks, and background worker. Deploy anywhere containers run.

### SQLite by Default
Production-ready SQLite configuration with the database stored outside the container. Perfect for solo developers, small teams, and internal applications. No database service fees—just simple, reliable data storage that backs up with your VPS. [Upgrade to PostgreSQL](/help/smallstack/database-postgresql/) when you need it.

## Built on Django Best Practices

- **Split settings** - Separate configurations for development, production, and testing
- **Apps in dedicated folder** - Clean organization with all apps in `apps/` directory
- **Custom User model** - Extensible user model from day one
- **Signals in separate files** - Clean separation of concerns
- **Tests alongside apps** - Tests live with their apps for easy maintenance
- **URL namespacing** - Organized URL patterns (e.g., `help:index`)
- **Organized static files** - Structured CSS and JavaScript
- **Template structure mirrors apps** - Intuitive template organization
- **SQLite with data separation** - Database stored in `/data/` directory, persists across container rebuilds
