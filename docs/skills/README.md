## Usage

AI agents should read relevant skill files before making changes to the corresponding parts of the codebase. For example:

- Before creating a new app → read `django-apps.md`
- Before creating templates → read `templates.md`
- Before building any admin/management page → read `admin-page-styling.md` (buttons, cards, tables, forms, etc.)
- Before modifying CSS/theming → read `theming-system.md`
- Before building a new page that should fit the SmallStack theme → read `building-themed-pages.md`
- Before adding a custom theme (Bootstrap, Tailwind, etc.) → read `adding-your-own-theme.md`
- Before deciding which theme approach to take → read `theme-scenarios.md`
- Before working with auth → read `authentication.md`
- Before adding htmx interactions → read `htmx-patterns.md`
- Before adding a help page → read `help-documentation.md`
- Before changing settings → read `settings.md`
- Before adding background tasks → read `background-tasks.md`
- Before working with activity tracking → read `activity-tracking.md`
- Before taking screenshots → read `screenshot-workflow.md`
- Before deploying with Docker → read `docker-deployment.md`
- Before deploying with Kamal → read `kamal-deployment.md`
- Before developing features → read `development-workflow.md`
- Before releasing a version → read `release-process.md`
- Before pulling upstream into downstream → read `integration-workflow.md`
- Before integrating with the SmallStack API → read `api-discovery.md`

## For Humans

These files are also useful for developers new to the project. They provide quick references for:

- Understanding how different systems work
- Following established patterns
- Finding the right files to modify

## Contributing

When adding significant new features or systems to the project, consider creating a corresponding skill file to document:

- File locations and structure
- Key concepts and patterns
- Step-by-step procedures
- Configuration options
- Best practices
