description: Running tasks outside the request-response cycle

# Background Tasks

Django 6.0 introduced a built-in **Tasks framework** for running code outside the HTTP request-response cycle. This enables offloading work like sending emails, processing data, or generating reports to background workers, keeping your web responses fast.

## Why Use Background Tasks?

Without background tasks, long-running operations block web requests:

```python
# Bad: User waits while email sends
def signup_view(request):
    user = create_user(request.POST)
    send_welcome_email(user)  # Blocks for 2-5 seconds
    return redirect("home")   # User finally sees response
```

With background tasks, the response is immediate:

```python
# Good: Email sends in background
from apps.accounts.tasks import send_welcome_email

def signup_view(request):
    user = create_user(request.POST)
    send_welcome_email.enqueue(user_id=user.id)  # Returns instantly
    return redirect("home")  # User sees response immediately
```

## How It Works

1. **Define a task** using the `@task` decorator
2. **Enqueue the task** with `.enqueue()` when needed
3. **Worker processes** pick up and execute queued tasks
4. **Results** are stored in the database for later retrieval

## Running the Worker

{{ project_name }} uses the **DatabaseBackend** which stores tasks in SQLite/PostgreSQL. To process tasks, run the worker:

```bash
# Start the background worker
uv run python manage.py db_worker
```

In development (DEBUG=True), the worker auto-reloads when code changes. Keep it running in a separate terminal while developing.

In production, the worker runs automatically inside the web container — no extra setup needed. For high-traffic sites that need independent scaling, you can run the worker as a separate container by setting `WORKER_INLINE=false`. See [Docker Deployment](/help/smallstack/docker-deployment/) for details.

## Defining Tasks

Create tasks in a `tasks.py` file. Tasks must be module-level functions:

```python
# apps/myapp/tasks.py
from django.tasks import task
from django.core.mail import send_mail

@task
def send_notification_email(user_email, message):
    """Send a notification email in the background."""
    return send_mail(
        subject="Notification",
        message=message,
        from_email=None,
        recipient_list=[user_email],
    )
```

### Task Parameters

The `@task` decorator accepts several options:

```python
@task(
    priority=5,           # Higher priority = processed first (default: 0)
    queue_name="email",   # Separate queues for different task types
    backend="default",    # Which backend to use
    takes_context=True,   # Receive TaskContext as first argument
)
def my_task(context, data):
    print(f"Task {context.task_result.id}, attempt {context.attempt}")
    return process(data)
```

## Enqueueing Tasks

Call `.enqueue()` to add a task to the queue:

```python
from apps.accounts.tasks import send_email_task

# Enqueue with arguments
result = send_email_task.enqueue(
    recipient="user@example.com",
    subject="Hello",
    message="This is your message."
)

# The result object contains the task ID
print(f"Task queued: {result.id}")
```

### Async Support

For async views, use `aenqueue()`:

```python
result = await send_email_task.aenqueue(
    recipient="user@example.com",
    subject="Hello",
    message="Async message."
)
```

## Checking Task Status

Retrieve and check task results:

```python
from apps.accounts.tasks import process_data_task

# Enqueue the task
result = process_data_task.enqueue(data={"items": [1, 2, 3]})
task_id = result.id

# Later, check status
result = process_data_task.get_result(task_id)
result.refresh()  # Update from database

print(result.status)  # PENDING, RUNNING, SUCCESSFUL, or FAILED

if result.status == "SUCCESSFUL":
    print(result.return_value)  # The task's return value
```

### Task Statuses

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| `PENDING` | Task is queued, waiting for a worker |
| `RUNNING` | Worker is currently executing the task |
| `SUCCESSFUL` | Task completed without errors |
| `FAILED` | Task raised an exception |

## Built-in Example Tasks

{{ project_name }} includes example tasks in `apps/smallstack/tasks.py`:

### send_email_task

Send emails in the background:

```python
from apps.accounts.tasks import send_email_task

result = send_email_task.enqueue(
    recipient="user@example.com",
    subject="Important Update",
    message="Here's your update content."
)
```

### send_welcome_email

Send a welcome email to a user by ID:

```python
from apps.accounts.tasks import send_welcome_email

# After creating a user
send_welcome_email.enqueue(user_id=user.id)
```

### process_data_task

Example of data processing in background:

```python
from apps.accounts.tasks import process_data_task

result = process_data_task.enqueue(
    data={"items": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]},
    operation="transform"
)
```

## Transaction Safety

When enqueueing tasks inside database transactions, use `on_commit` to prevent race conditions:

```python
from functools import partial
from django.db import transaction

with transaction.atomic():
    order = Order.objects.create(...)
    # Task won't be enqueued if transaction rolls back
    transaction.on_commit(
        partial(send_order_confirmation.enqueue, order_id=order.id)
    )
```

## Serialization Requirements

Task arguments and return values must be **JSON-serializable**:

```python
# These work
send_email.enqueue(email="test@example.com")  # strings
process.enqueue(count=42)                      # numbers
analyze.enqueue(items=[1, 2, 3])              # lists
transform.enqueue(data={"key": "value"})      # dicts

# These don't work
process.enqueue(date=datetime.now())          # datetime objects
process.enqueue(user=user_instance)           # model instances
process.enqueue(data={(1, 2): "value"})       # tuple keys
```

For model instances, pass the ID instead:

```python
# Instead of: send_welcome_email.enqueue(user=user)
send_welcome_email.enqueue(user_id=user.id)
```

## Task Maintenance

Clean up old completed tasks periodically:

```bash
# Delete tasks older than 7 days
uv run python manage.py prune_db_task_results --age 7

# See all options
uv run python manage.py prune_db_task_results --help
```

## Configuration

Task settings are in `config/settings/base.py`:

```python
TASKS = {
    "default": {
        "BACKEND": "django_tasks_db.DatabaseBackend",
        "QUEUES": ["default", "email"],
    }
}
```

### Multiple Queues

Separate queues allow different workers to handle different task types:

```bash
# Worker for all queues (recommended)
uv run python manage.py db_worker --queue-name "*"

# Worker for specific queues (comma-separated)
uv run python manage.py db_worker --queue-name "default,email"

# Worker for default queue only
uv run python manage.py db_worker
```

### Development Without Worker

For simple development, you can run tasks immediately (synchronously):

```python
# config/settings/development.py
TASKS = {
    "default": {
        "BACKEND": "django.tasks.backends.immediate.ImmediateBackend",
    }
}
```

This blocks the request until the task completes, so it's only for testing.

## Alternative: Celery

{{ project_name }} uses Django's built-in task framework with `django-tasks-db` for simplicity. This provides:

- No external dependencies (uses your existing database)
- Simple setup and configuration
- Automatic worker reload in development
- Good enough for most small-to-medium applications

For **high-volume production** systems, consider [Celery](https://docs.celeryq.dev/):

| Feature | Django Tasks | Celery |
|---------|-------------|--------|
| Setup complexity | Simple | Moderate |
| External dependencies | None | Redis/RabbitMQ |
| Scheduling | Basic | Advanced (cron-like) |
| Retries | Manual | Built-in with backoff |
| Monitoring | Basic | Flower dashboard |
| Scaling | Limited | Distributed workers |
| Best for | Simple apps | High-volume systems |

To use Celery instead:

1. Install: `uv add celery redis`
2. Configure a message broker (Redis recommended)
3. Create `celery.py` in your config directory
4. Define tasks with `@shared_task` decorator
5. Run: `celery -A config worker -l INFO`

See the [Celery documentation](https://docs.celeryq.dev/en/stable/django/first-steps-with-django.html) for detailed setup.

## Production Deployment

In production (Docker Compose or Kamal), the background worker runs **inline inside the web container** by default. No separate worker service or configuration is needed — the entrypoint script starts `db_worker` as a background process automatically.

This is controlled by the `WORKER_INLINE` environment variable, which defaults to `true`.

### Scaling Up: Separate Worker Container

For high-traffic sites or heavy background workloads, you can split the worker into a separate container. This gives you independent scaling, separate log streams, and Docker-managed crash recovery.

Set `WORKER_INLINE=false` on the web service and uncomment the `worker` service/role in your deployment config:

**Docker Compose:**

```yaml
services:
  web:
    environment:
      - WORKER_INLINE=false

  worker:
    build: .
    command: python manage.py db_worker --queue-name "*"
    volumes:
      - db_data:/data
    depends_on:
      web:
        condition: service_healthy
```

**Kamal:**

```yaml
env:
  clear:
    WORKER_INLINE: "false"

servers:
  web:
    - 123.45.67.89
  worker:
    hosts:
      - 123.45.67.89
    cmd: python manage.py db_worker --queue-name "*"
```

### Inline vs Separate: Trade-offs

| | Inline (default) | Separate Container |
|---|---|---|
| RAM per project | ~1x | ~2x (web + worker) |
| Worker crash recovery | Restart loop restarts process | Docker restarts container |
| Log separation | Mixed in one stream | Separate streams |
| Independent scaling | No | Yes |
| Deploy complexity | Single container | Worker role in deploy config |

**Use inline** for most sites — marketing pages, internal tools, apps with occasional background tasks.

**Switch to separate** when worker load could starve web requests, you have heavy/long-running tasks, or you need independent scaling or monitoring.

## Troubleshooting

### Tasks not running

1. Is the worker running? Check with `ps aux | grep db_worker`
2. Are there pending tasks? Check in Django admin or database
3. Is the correct settings module loaded?

### Tasks failing silently

Check task results for errors:

```python
result = my_task.get_result(task_id)
if result.status == "FAILED":
    for error in result.errors:
        print(f"Exception: {error.exception_class}")
        print(error.traceback)
```

### Worker not picking up code changes

In development, the worker should auto-reload. If not:

1. Check DEBUG is True
2. Restart the worker manually
3. Ensure `--reload` flag is used
