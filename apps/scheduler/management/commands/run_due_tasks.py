"""Fire all due schedules once (system-cron / systemd-timer path).

    * * * * * cd /app && python manage.py run_due_tasks

Idempotent and safe to run every minute. Use exactly one trigger per
deployment (this, the /scheduler/tick/ POST, or scheduler_beat) — the atomic
claim in run_due_jobs makes an accidental overlap safe rather than duplicating,
but running two on purpose just wastes work.
