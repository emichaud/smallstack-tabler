## [Unreleased]

## [0.13.0] - 2026-07-12

### Added
- **Runbook — a first-class dynamic-documents app** (`apps/runbook/`): versioned markdown documents
  with images, sections, keyword + full-text search, retention, subscriptions, and portable ZIP
  bundles — readable and writable from the web UI, a transport-agnostic service layer, REST, MCP,
  and a unix-style CLI. (Previously the standalone `smallstack-runbook` package; now permanent core.
  The `smallstack_runbook` DB label is preserved, so existing tables/migrations reuse as-is.)
- **Runbook CLI** (`manage.py runbook` / the `rb` console script): `ls`, `toc`, `find` (BM25-ranked
  search), `cat` (`<ref>@N` reads an earlier version), `write` (stdin), `cp`, `rm`, `restore`, `mv`,
  `revert`, `log`, `stat`, `mkdir`, `sections`, `publish`/`unpublish`. Every verb takes `--json`.
- **Runbook REST API**: full document lifecycle (`api/documents/…`, incl. `append`/`move`/`archive`/
  `unarchive`/`revert`/`copy`) plus an `api/runbooks/…` container resource (list/create, detail +
  table of contents, sections, publish/unpublish). All registered in the OpenAPI schema (Swagger/
  ReDoc) and ownership-scoped. `GET api/documents/?q=` is BM25-ranked (substring fallback).
- **Runbook MCP tools** + search-engine registration (`search_runbook_documents`, global omnibar).
- **Runbook dashboard widget** on the central `/smallstack/` dashboard (runbook + document counts).
- `api_doctor` now lists hand-registered (`register_api_path`) custom endpoints, so its inventory
  matches the OpenAPI schema (and warns on any `url_name` that no longer reverses).

### Changed
- Client-IP resolution is now proxy-aware and shared by the activity log and the django-axes login
  lockout. Behind a trusted reverse proxy (`TRUST_PROXY_HEADERS`, defaulted on in production for
  kamal-proxy) the real client is read from the rightmost, proxy-appended `X-Forwarded-For` entry
  (spoof-resistant); otherwise the unspoofable `REMOTE_ADDR` is used. One helper
  (`apps/smallstack/client_ip.py`) is the single source of truth.
- The markdown hardening from the CRUD field-preview is extracted into a reusable
  `harden_markdown_renderer()` and shared with the runbook renderer.

### Fixed
- **Stored XSS in runbook document rendering** — user- and AI-authored document bodies could inject
  `<script>` / `<img onerror>` / `javascript:` links that executed in a viewer's session. The
  renderer now escapes raw HTML and blanks dangerous URL schemes, and drops the unsafe `md_in_html`
  and `attr_list` extensions. Regression-tested.
- Runbook ZIP export silently omitted section-less ("loose") documents attached straight to a
  runbook — they are now included (loose docs at the archive root).
- Runbook CLI N+1 queries in `ls`, `toc`, and `sections`.
- MCP activity page: the filter `Apply`/`Reset` buttons now align with the control row.
- Silenced the django-axes INFO startup banner in development (it polluted piped CLI output).

### Security
- django-axes now resolves the real client IP behind kamal-proxy, so per-IP brute-force lockout is
  effective in production (previously every request keyed to the proxy's address, neutering it).

## [0.12.4] - 2026-07-11

### Security
- **Dependencies:** bumped Django (→6.0.7), Pillow (→12.3.0), starlette, pydantic-settings, pygments,
  and pytest to their fix releases — `pip-audit` goes from 13 known vulnerabilities to 0.
- Fixed stored-XSS in the CRUD field-preview markdown renderer — arbitrary field content can no
  longer inject script. Raw HTML is neutralized (rendered as escaped text), dangerous link/image
  URL schemes (`javascript:`, `data:`, …) are blanked via a URL allowlist, and the extension set
  is restricted to `fenced_code`/`tables` (no `md_in_html` / `attr_list`). Regression-tested.
- Fixed stored-XSS in search-result snippets — the plain-text snippet is no longer rendered `|safe`.
- CSP: added `base-uri 'self'` and `object-src 'none'` directives (no inline-script trade-off).

### Added
- `register_api_path` — let custom `@api_view` endpoints join the OpenAPI schema.
- Maintenance-window tooling for heartbeat/status: `manage.py maintenance` command and
  `apps/heartbeat/maintenance.py` (open a maintenance window / SLA-exclude a deploy).
- Per-app `README.md` files, plus `SECURITY.md` and this `CHANGELOG.md`.

### Fixed
- Ordering by a computed/non-DB column no longer 500s — a misconfigured `ordering_fields` (or a
  hand-crafted `?ordering=`) degrades to no-sort instead of raising `FieldError`.
- Search: a model registered *after* the search app's `ready()` (from a later app in
  `INSTALLED_APPS`) now gets its per-model `search_<plural>` MCP tool — registration is now
  independent of app order.
- OpenAPI `info.version` and `MCP_SERVER_VERSION` derive from the package version (new
  `SMALLSTACK_VERSION` setting) instead of a hardcoded `1.0.0`.
- Dev `SECRET_KEY` is persisted to a gitignored `.secret_key` so all local processes share one key —
  `screenshot_auth` sessions are no longer silently rejected on a fresh clone.

### Changed
- API-layer dedup: `json.loads` bodies via `_load_json_body`; the three HTML-pagination sites via
  `attach_display_helpers`; `_api_list` and the OpenAPI path builders slimmed via extracted helpers.
- Heartbeat: six function-based views moved to a shared `staff_required` decorator.
- Type hints completed on `apps/activity`, `apps/tasks`, `apps/profile`, and `apps/smallstack/displays.py`;
  narrowed/logged several broad `except` handlers.
- Standardized test layout (`accounts`/`heartbeat` → `tests/` packages); `apps/tasks` coverage 0% → 99%.
- Docs: unified "Coming soon" framing for `@scheduled` + vector search; completed the CLI reference.

## [0.12.3] - 2026

### Fixed
- Invisible status calendar/timeline cells on standalone status pages.

## [0.12.2] - 2026

### Changed
- Maintenance-aware status: uptime/SLA calculations exclude scheduled maintenance windows.

### Fixed
- Test-suite robustness improvements.

## [0.12.1] - 2026

### Added
- `merge-0.12.0` upgrade skill documenting the v0.12.0 migration path.

## [0.12.0] - 2026

### Added
- **Pluggable status monitoring system** — register a Service + Monitor to track a
  subsystem's uptime/health on `/smallstack/status/`; add status visualizations.
  See `docs/skills/status-monitors.md`.

### Changed
- MCP and Search are decoupled from the status system (independent enable flags).
- Daily-timeline "today" coloring and doctor-command flag-awareness fixes.

### Removed
- **django-tables2** and the public `apps.smallstack.tables` / `table_class` surface.
  Downstream projects importing these must migrate — see `UPGRADING.md`.

## [0.11.x] - 2026

Condensed highlights of the v0.11 series (see git history for per-patch detail):

### Added
- Account invites by email + passwordless code login with branded emails (`apps/accounts`).
- Username-or-email login (`EmailOrUsernameBackend`).
- `usermanager`: password-on-create, edit actions, and guardrails.
- Consolidated dashboard stat cards into one `{% stat_card %}` standard with drill-down modals.
- API endpoints admin page; clickable list rows; table pagination.
- Editorial "Getting Started" redesign; apps-dropdown redesign; Search section on Home.

### Fixed
- **v0.11.14** — pinned test settings to `config.settings.test` (`--ds` in `addopts`) so the
  suite no longer silently ran under dev settings; hermetic dev-superuser test; v0.12 upgrade note.
- **v0.11.13** — platform re-audit hardening: security fixes (OAuth scope→role capping, token
  scope, backups, allowed hosts), Postgres fixes, **GitHub Actions CI** (SQLite + Postgres matrix
  + ruff), and the django-tables2 removal groundwork.
- Django-6 `log_action` breakage that broke programmatic API/MCP write audit logging.
- Explorer detail grid rendering every boolean as ✓ regardless of value.
