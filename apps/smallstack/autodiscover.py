"""Shared app-module autodiscovery.

Django auto-imports each app's ``models.py`` and ``admin.py`` but **not**
``views.py``. SmallStack's ``CRUDView`` subclasses live in ``views.py``, and
importing a module is what registers its CRUDViews into ``CRUDView._registry``
(via ``__init_subclass__``). Several subsystems walk that registry at startup —
Search (``enable_search``), the MCP factory (``enable_mcp``), the REST layer,
Explorer — so *something* must import every app's ``views.py`` before those walks
run.

This used to be a side effect of the MCP app's autodiscover, which silently coupled
Search (and any registry consumer) to ``SMALLSTACK_MCP_ENABLED``: turning MCP off
skipped the autodiscover and left the registry under-populated. The logic now lives
here and runs unconditionally from ``SmallStackConfig.ready()`` (the framework core
loads before any consumer), so the registry is fully populated regardless of
feature toggles.

    ``ClassDef`` body. The same characters inside a string literal, comment, or
    docstring don't count — which matters because SmallStack documents its own
    flags with embedded CRUDView examples, and a line-anchored regex can't tell
    a teaching example in a docstring from a live opt-in.

    Used by both ``api_doctor`` and ``mcp_doctor`` to find opt-in files, so the

    fixture that is *supposed* to stay out of the registry, and the health
    checks (``api_doctor`` / ``mcp_doctor`` "orphan files") must not report it
    as an unregistered opt-in — their suggested fix, importing the module from
    ``AppConfig.ready()``, would publish a test view as a live API/MCP surface.

    Both layouts count. Excluding only a ``tests/`` package missed the flat
    ``test_*.py`` convention that ``apps/smallstack`` itself uses, so
    ``smallstack/test_bulk_ops.py`` was reported as an orphan by both doctors
