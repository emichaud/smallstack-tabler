"""Retention for captured log records — age first, then a hard row cap.

    */15 * * * * cd /app && python manage.py prune_logs

Two limits, because either alone fails somewhere. Age alone lets an incident
that produces a million lines in ten minutes fill the disk. A row cap alone
keeps stale records around forever on a quiet deployment. Whichever binds
first wins.
