"""Project-root pytest configuration.

Ensures the MCP test-only Widget + Gadget tables exist for every test
session. They live as managed=False models in apps/mcp/tests/models.py so
production migrations don't touch them — schema_editor adds them at
session start and they vanish when the in-memory SQLite test DB is torn
down. Without this, Explorer's iteration of CRUDView._registry would hit
the test-only tables and fail with "no such table" for any tests outside
apps/mcp/.
