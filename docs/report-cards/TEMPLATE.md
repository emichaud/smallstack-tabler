# SmallStack Quality Report Card — <Label>

| | |
|---|---|
| **Project** | <name> |
| **Version** | <x.y.z> |
| **Branch / commit** | `<branch>` @ `<shortsha>` |
| **Date** | <YYYY-MM-DD> |
| **Reviewer** | <who / how> |
| **Scope** | <what was assessed this cycle> |

## Overall: **<Grade>**
<One-paragraph verdict: the headline state, what changed, whether it's merge/release-ready. Respect the
BLOCKER/MAJOR caps — an open BLOCKER makes this F.>

## Scorecard
| # | Area | Grade | Trend | Evidence |
|---|------|:-----:|:-----:|----------|
| 1 | Security | <A–F> | <↑→↓> | <0 vulns; findings; hardening> |
| 2 | Code Quality | | | <ruff; duplication; types> |
| 3 | Testing & Coverage | | | <N passed / 0 failed; coverage %> |
| 4 | Documentation & Skills | | | <docs accuracy; index updated> |
| 5 | Architecture & Design | | | <reuse; boundaries> |
| 6 | Operability & Release | | | <doctors; migrations; setup> |
| 7 | Accessibility & Theming | | | <palettes; or "— not assessed"> |
| 8 | Locality of Behavior | | | <files-to-understand-a-feature; colocation; anti-local patterns> |

_Trend is vs the previous card (↑ improved · → held · ↓ regressed); "baseline" on the first card._
