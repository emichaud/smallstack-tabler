"""Dashboard widgets surfaced by the MCP module.

Lands on /smallstack/ next to Backups, Help, Activity, etc. The widget is
intentionally cheap — it does NOT run mcp_doctor's full self-test (no DB
writes, no HTTP) so loading the dashboard stays snappy. It picks the
single signal that's most useful at a glance:

  headline:  N tools registered (or "0 tools" if empty)
  detail:    "All checks passing", "N warning(s)" — depending on registry
             vs orphan-file diff (the same heuristic mcp_doctor uses).
  status:    "operational" | "degraded"  → drives the headline color via
             the existing .widget-status-* CSS rules used by Heartbeat.

Clicking the widget jumps to /smallstack/mcp/ (the Health page).
