"""Read-only REST surface for captured log records — ``/api/logger/``.

The staff viewer at ``/smallstack/logs/`` is the *human* surface, and it stays
exactly as it is. This is the surface a **machine** uses: a CI job asserting an
error was logged, a frontend dev panel resolving an ``X-Request-ID``, and above
all an AI agent driving a debugging session with nothing but an API token —
turn capture up, reproduce, read the lines, correlate, turn capture back down.

Two consumers, two shapes. The differences are deliberate:

* **Cursor, not page numbers.** ``?after_id=`` returns records strictly newer
  than a known id. Page numbers are wrong for a live tail: new rows arrive at
  the top and shift everything down, so page 2 re-reads what page 1 already
  returned. A human scrolling doesn't notice; a polling loop double-counts.
* **Unknown query parameters are a 400.** A human eventually notices a result
  set looks wrong. An agent does not — ``?sevrity=ERROR`` would silently return
  the *unfiltered* table, which reads as a successful query, and every
  conclusion drawn afterwards is built on it. Failing loudly costs one retry.
* **Bounded payloads.** One traceback can be 20 KB; fifty of them would fill an
  agent's context for no benefit. Lists truncate ``exc_text`` and flag it with
  ``exc_truncated``; the detail endpoint serves the full text for the one
  record that matters.
* **``applied_filters`` is echoed back**, so a caller can verify the server
  understood the query it thinks it sent.

Filter *semantics* are shared with the viewer rather than reimplemented — same
"this level and above", same hierarchy-aware logger prefix (``logger_match``),
same message-plus-traceback search. Two implementations of "what does
``logger=apps.telemetry`` mean" would eventually disagree, and the round-2
sibling-prefix finding was exactly that bug in one of them.

Reads are staff-scoped; the single write — opening and closing a capture
window — is refused for read-only tokens, so a CI job or a monitoring script
can assert an error was logged without being able to turn DEBUG on in
production. See ``docs/logger-api-spec.md``.

Auditing note: reads are deliberately **not** logged through the logging system
being read. A ``logger.info()`` here would be captured, so reading logs would
create records that the next read returns — the same feedback shape
``DatabaseLogHandler``'s thread-local recursion guard exists to break, one
level up. ``/api/logger/`` is also excluded from activity logging by default
(``ACTIVITY_EXCLUDE_PATHS``) so an agent polling a tail doesn't fill the table
it is reading with its own poll traffic.
