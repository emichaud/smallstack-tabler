# SQLite Database

{{ project_name }} uses **SQLite** as its default database—and that's a deliberate choice, not a compromise. For solo developers, small teams, and internal applications, SQLite is often the *best* database option, not just the easiest one.

> **See also:** [PostgreSQL Database](/help/smallstack/database-postgresql/) for when you need to scale beyond SQLite.

## Why SQLite?

SQLite has experienced a renaissance in the web development community. What was once dismissed as "just for development" is now recognized as a **production-ready database** for many use cases.

### The Numbers

- **Handles thousands of requests per second** on modern hardware
- **Supports databases up to 281 terabytes** (far more than most apps need)
- **Used in production** by countless mobile apps, embedded systems, and yes—web applications
- **Most deployed database in the world** (every smartphone, browser, and countless applications)

> *"SQLite is likely used more than all other database engines combined. SQLite is in every iPhone and every Android phone, every Mac and every Windows 10 machine, every Firefox, Chrome, and Safari browser."*
> — [sqlite.org](https://www.sqlite.org/mostdeployed.html)

The SQLite developers acknowledge it's likely the most widely deployed database engine in existence, largely due to its ubiquity as an embedded database in mobile devices, set-top boxes, automotive systems, and consumer electronics.

### Perfect For

| Use Case | Why SQLite Works |
|----------|------------------|
| Internal tools | Single-user or small team, infrequent writes |
| Admin dashboards | Read-heavy workloads are SQLite's strength |
| Prototypes & MVPs | Ship fast, migrate later if needed |
| Personal projects | Zero configuration, zero cost |
| Content sites | Blogs, documentation, portfolios |
| Budget-conscious deployments | No database service fees |

## How {{ project_name }} Sets Up SQLite

The project separates the database file from the application code, which is critical for containerized deployments.

### The Data Directory Pattern

```
/app/
├── apps/               # Application code (disposable)
├── static/             # Static files (disposable)
├── data/               # Database lives here (PERSISTENT)
│   └── db.sqlite3
└── media/              # Uploads (PERSISTENT)
```

In `config/settings/base.py`:

```python
DATABASES = {
    "default": {
        "ENGINE": "django.db.backends.sqlite3",
        "NAME": BASE_DIR / "data" / "db.sqlite3",
    }
}
```

### Why This Matters for Docker

Containers are **ephemeral**—they can be destroyed and recreated at any time. By mounting the `data/` directory as a volume, your database persists across container rebuilds:

```yaml
# docker-compose.yml
volumes:
  - ./data:/app/data      # Local development

# deploy.yml (Kamal)
volumes:
  - /root/app_data/db:/app/data   # VPS deployment
```

**Key insight:** The database lives on your VPS filesystem, not inside the container. When you deploy a new version, the container is replaced but the data remains untouched.

### Backup Strategy

With SQLite on a VPS, backups are straightforward:

1. **VPS snapshots** — Most providers offer automated snapshots. Enable them and your database is automatically backed up.

2. **File copy** — SQLite is a single file. Copy it anywhere:
   ```bash
   # On the VPS
   cp /root/app_data/db/db.sqlite3 /root/backups/db-$(date +%Y%m%d).sqlite3
   ```

3. **SQLite backup command** — For live backups without stopping the app:
   ```bash
   sqlite3 /root/app_data/db/db.sqlite3 ".backup '/root/backups/db-backup.sqlite3'"
   ```

## SQLite Best Practices

### Enable WAL Mode

Write-Ahead Logging improves concurrent read performance. {{ project_name }} enables this automatically, but here's how it works:

```python
# In settings
DATABASES = {
    "default": {
        "ENGINE": "django.db.backends.sqlite3",
        "NAME": BASE_DIR / "data" / "db.sqlite3",
        "OPTIONS": {
            "init_command": "PRAGMA journal_mode=WAL;",
        },
    }
}
```

### Understand the Limitations

SQLite has **one write at a time**. This is fine for:
- ✅ Read-heavy workloads (admin dashboards, content sites)
- ✅ Low-to-moderate write volume (internal tools, small teams)
- ✅ Single-server deployments

Consider PostgreSQL if you need:
- ❌ High concurrent write volume
- ❌ Multiple servers writing to the same database
- ❌ Advanced features (full-text search, JSON operators, PostGIS)

## Cost Comparison

Consider hosting a small Django application:

**With Managed PostgreSQL:**

| Item | Monthly Cost |
|------|-------------|
| VPS (basic) | $5-10 |
| Managed PostgreSQL | $15+ |
| **Total** | **$20-25+** |

**With SQLite:**

| Item | Monthly Cost |
|------|-------------|
| VPS (basic) | $5-10 |
| Database | $0 (included) |
| **Total** | **$5-10** |

**Savings: $10-15/month ($120-180/year)** per application

For a solo developer running multiple small projects, SQLite can save hundreds of dollars annually.

## The Trending Shift

The "SQLite in production" movement has gained significant momentum:

- **Ruby on Rails 8** ships with SQLite as a viable production option
- **Litestream** enables real-time SQLite replication
- **Turso/LibSQL** brings SQLite to the edge
- **Major frameworks** are reconsidering SQLite as a first-class citizen

The web development community is recognizing that **not every application needs PostgreSQL**. For many projects, SQLite's simplicity, reliability, and zero-cost operation make it the pragmatic choice.

## When to Migrate

You'll know it's time to consider PostgreSQL when:

1. **Write contention** — You're seeing database lock errors under load
2. **Team growth** — Multiple developers need concurrent write access
3. **Scale requirements** — You need horizontal scaling or read replicas
4. **Feature needs** — You need full-text search, JSONB, or geospatial queries

Until then, SQLite serves admirably. And when you do need to migrate, the path is well-documented.

## Quick Reference

| Task | Command |
|------|---------|
| Access SQLite shell | `sqlite3 data/db.sqlite3` |
| Backup database | `sqlite3 data/db.sqlite3 ".backup 'backup.sqlite3'"` |
| Check database size | `ls -lh data/db.sqlite3` |
| Vacuum (reclaim space) | `sqlite3 data/db.sqlite3 "VACUUM;"` |
| Check integrity | `sqlite3 data/db.sqlite3 "PRAGMA integrity_check;"` |

### In Docker/Kamal

```bash
# Access SQLite shell
kamal app exec "sqlite3 /app/data/db.sqlite3"

# Run Django shell
kamal app exec "python manage.py dbshell"
```
