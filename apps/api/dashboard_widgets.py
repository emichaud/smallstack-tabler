"""Dashboard widget for the API admin module.

Lands on ``/smallstack/`` next to the MCP widget. Cheap by design — it
runs the cheap subset of api_doctor's checks (no HTTP, no DB writes) so
the dashboard stays snappy. The headline is endpoint count; the detail
mirrors the highest-severity signal we can compute without making a
request (orphan files, threats over 24h once Phase 3 ships).
