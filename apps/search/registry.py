"""Search registry — the canonical list of opt-in CRUDViews.

A CRUDView declares ``enable_search = True`` and the search app
registers it here at startup. The registry then drives every other
piece of the search system: index maintenance via signals, MCP tool
generation, the search page's per-model grouping, the dashboard
widget's count.

Lookup is by model label (``"<app_label>.<ModelName>"``) so handlers
that get a Django ``sender`` can find the matching IndexedView quickly.

    ``user`` is the request user (or ``None`` for trusted internal callers
    like the MCP server). Two gates apply per registered view, in order:

      1. **Access gate** — :func:`_user_can_see` evaluates the view's
         declared ``search_access`` against the caller. Non-matching
         views are dropped before any query runs (no listing, no
         preview, no leak).

      2. **Visibility filter** — if the view declares a
         ``search_visibility(queryset, user) -> queryset`` callable,
         the surviving hits are re-filtered through it. Hits whose pk
         doesn't survive the filter are dropped.

    Staff and trusted-internal (``user=None``) callers bypass both
    gates. Visibility filters that raise fail safe: the view's hits are
    dropped entirely rather than leaking unfiltered rows.

    Used by the topbar omnibar, the admin /smallstack/search/ page,
    the public /search/ page, and the ``search_all`` MCP tool.
