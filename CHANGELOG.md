## [Unreleased]

## [0.16.2] - 2026-08-15

### Fixed
- **Empty states rendered raw template source into the page.** Django's
  tokenizer matches tags with `{%.*?%}` and **no `DOTALL`**, so a `{% %}` tag
  split across lines is never parsed — it is emitted as literal text. Four
  empty-state includes were wrapped for readability and shipped that way, so a
  visitor saw:

  ```
  {% include "smallstack/includes/empty_state.html" with
     no_card=True
     title="No matches"
     body="No "|add:object_verbose_name_plural|add:" matched your search…" %}
  ```

  This hit **every CRUDView on the default templates whenever its list was
  empty** — a no-match search or a fresh install with nothing added yet — on
  both the plain page load and the HTMX toolbar swap, plus the dashboard
  "no widgets available" state and the MCP tools admin.

  The pattern spread because `empty_state.html`'s own usage example was written
  wrapped and every caller copied it; that example is now a single line carrying
  an explicit warning. A whole-tree sweep test now fails the build on any
  multi-line tag — the defect is invisible in review, since the template reads
  perfectly well.
- **A missing `object_verbose_name_plural` raised instead of degrading.** With
  the tag parsing again, `body="No "|add:object_verbose_name_plural` makes that
  variable a filter *argument*, and an unresolved filter argument raises
  `VariableDoesNotExist` rather than rendering empty the way `{{ missing }}`
  does. `_CRUDContextMixin` always supplies it, but this partial is also
  included by hand-written list templates (`usermanager` does, and downstream
  projects do) — it now resolves through `{% with %}` with a default noun.

### Added
- **The related-tab partial is overridable like every other CRUD surface.**
  `_CRUDRelatedTabBase` hardcoded its template while every sibling — including
  `_CRUDFieldPreviewBase` directly above it — resolves through
  `_get_template_names(suffix)`, so it was the one CRUD surface a project could
  not override per model or per app. It now offers the same instance → app →
  default chain. The shipped partial lives at
  `crud/includes/related_tab_content.html`, which doesn't fit the
  `crud/object_{suffix}` default convention, so that path is appended as the
  final fallback — the loader takes the first template that exists, so behavior
  is unchanged when no override is present.

## [0.16.1] - 2026-08-14

### Fixed
- **`CalendarDisplay` compared `DateTimeField`s against naive month boundaries.**
  Filtering used plain `date` bounds, so under `USE_TZ` Django built a naive
  midnight, emitted "received a naive datetime while time zone support is
  active", then coerced it with the **default** timezone — while the bucketing
  side used `localtime()`, the **current** one. Two halves of the same display
  deciding "is this in the month?" through different clocks. Boundaries are now
  coerced to the type each field expects (aware midnight for datetimes, the
  plain date for `DateField`s), resolved independently for the start and end
  fields.

  **No events move.** Verified against rows straddling both month edges,
  including exact midnights: old and new code select identically. The two
  timezones coincide because nothing activates a per-request timezone (the
  profile timezone is applied by a template filter), so the drift this prevents
  is latent — it would only appear if timezone-activating middleware were added.
  Removes 24 warnings from the test suite.
- **`api_doctor` detected opt-ins by regex while `mcp_doctor` used AST.** The
  line-anchored regex matched `enable_api = True` on any line with only
  whitespace before it — i.e. exactly how a code example is indented inside a
  docstring, which is how this codebase documents its own flags (8 in-scope
  modules already mention `enable_api` in prose). Nothing was misreported: of
  two regex/AST disagreements repo-wide, both sat outside the scan's scope. That
  was the problem — the check was correct only because a directory exclusion
  happened to cover the one offending file.

  Both doctors now share `has_enable_classvar(source, marker)` in
  `apps/smallstack/autodiscover.py`, so they agree on what an opt-in is. With
  AST the `management/` exclusion is unnecessary, so `api_doctor` scans that
  directory again — closing the opposite gap, where a genuine opt-in defined in
  a management command was invisible to it but visible to `mcp_doctor`.

## [0.16.0] - 2026-08-14

### Changed
- **`CalendarDisplay` caps events rendered per day (`max_per_day`, default 5).**
  The calendar rendered one chip — plus a hover-tooltip subtree — for every
  record in the visible month, so a high-volume site produced tens of thousands
  of DOM nodes and a calendar that took seconds to paint, or never usefully did.
  Cells now render at most 5 events followed by a **"+N more"** link that
  expands that single day in full (`?day=YYYY-MM-DD`). Overflow events are
  counted, not materialised.

  The point isn't the constant factor — it's that rendered chips are now bounded
  by `max_per_day × days_in_month` **regardless of record count**. Measured on
  200 seeded records: 201 chips / 171 KB before, 26 chips / 73 KB after.

  Capping is a *rendering* limit only: the header total and every "+N more"
  badge still report exact counts. **This changes what existing calendars
  display** — pass `max_per_day=None` to restore the previous behavior.

### Fixed
- **Related tabs 500'd when the related view had no DETAIL action.**
  `_CRUDRelatedTabBase` hardcoded `crud_actions = [Action.DETAIL]`, so
  `{% crud_table %}` reversed `<url_base>-detail` for a view that never
  generates that route (`get_urls` only registers it when `actions` include
  DETAIL). Because related tabs load lazily over HTMX, the NoReverseMatch
  surfaced as a tab with a count badge and an empty body rather than a visible
  error. The tab now forwards what the related view actually routes — DETAIL,
  else UPDATE, else unlinked — matching `crud_table`'s documented fallback.
  DELETE is never forwarded, and exactly one action is passed so a tab whose
  target routes both doesn't grow an Edit column it never had.
- **Related tabs rendered child rows through the parent's hooks.**
  `crud_config` stayed the parent CRUDView's, and `{% crud_table %}` reads
  `row_link_url()`, `row_actions()` and `column_widths` off it — so a parent
  that redirects its row links silently pointed a child row at an unrelated
  record that happened to share its pk. Fails silently, so worth re-checking any
  related tab under a CRUDView that overrides those hooks.
- **`api_doctor` / `mcp_doctor` reported test fixtures as unregistered opt-ins.**
  Both excluded test code by directory (`tests/`), missing the flat `test_*.py`
  convention `apps/smallstack` uses — so `smallstack/test_bulk_ops.py` was
  flagged as an orphan on every run and on the `/smallstack/api/` and
  `/smallstack/mcp/` pages. A CRUDView declared in a test is meant to stay out
  of the registry; the advertised fix (importing it from `AppConfig.ready()`)
  would have published a test view as a live REST endpoint and MCP tool. The
  shared `is_test_module()` helper now lives in
  `apps/smallstack/autodiscover.py` and covers both layouts.

## [0.15.2] - 2026-08-12

### Fixed
- **Invisible "Copy" button on the token-reveal page (gold + high contrast).**
  The button set a background but no `color`, so it inherited `--button-fg` —
  the foreground meant to pair with a *solid* `--primary` fill. On the only two
  palettes with a dark `--button-fg` (gold `#1a1a1a`, high-contrast `#000000`)
  that painted dark text on a dark card and the label disappeared. It now uses
  the existing `.btn-outline` class.
- **Unreadable MCP consent page (`/mcp/oauth/authorize`) on dark themes.** The
  template referenced `--border`, `--muted-fg` and `--code-bg`, none of which
  were defined anywhere, so each always resolved to its hard-coded *light*
  fallback: gray borders on dark cards, and `#f4f4f4` chips whose inherited text
  was also light. That made the client id and the **redirect host** — the one
  field a user must read before granting access — invisible. Its Allow button
  also hard-coded `color: #fff` over `var(--primary)`, i.e. white-on-white on
  the high-contrast palette.
- **Links ignored the selected palette in light mode.** Every dark palette block
  set `--link-fg`, but the gold / orange / purple / dark-blue *light* blocks set
  only `--link-color`. SmallStack's own CSS reads `--link-color`, while Django
  admin's `a:link, a:visited` rule reads `--link-fg` — so every plain anchor
  stayed on admin's `#417893` teal. All light blocks now set both.
- **The default `django` palette had no light block at all**, so light mode fell
  through to Django admin's colors (`--primary: #79aec8`) instead of
  SmallStack's. `admin/css/base.css` declares its variables under
  `html[data-theme="light"], :root`; that first branch scores (0,1,1) and the
  theme JS always writes an explicit `data-theme`, so it outranks theme.css's
  plain `:root` (0,1,0) no matter which file loads last. Adds a django light
  block built on emerald-700 `#047857` (5.5:1 on white — the dark palette's
  `#10b981` is only 2.5:1 and unusable for accent text).

### Added
- **`--border`, `--muted-fg` and `--code-bg`** are now defined in `theme.css`.
  They were referenced by templates but declared nowhere, which is what let the
  bugs above degrade silently. Defined as derived aliases (`var(--card-border)`,
  `var(--text-muted)`, and a `color-mix` recipe) so they track the active theme
  and palette with no per-palette overrides. Prefer the specific token in new
  code.
- **`apps/smallstack/test_palette_css.py`** — parses `palettes.css` against
  `UserProfile.COLOR_PALETTE_CHOICES` and fails if any palette is missing a
  light or dark block, or omits `--link-fg` / `--link-color`.

## [0.15.1] - 2026-08-09

### Internal
- **Test coverage backfill (codebase-review F4).** No behavior change — new
  tests only. `postgres_fts.py` 0% → 83% (a Postgres-gated suite that runs under
  `TEST_DB=postgres` and skips on SQLite); `api.py` 75% → 88% (the auth endpoints
  — register / password change / admin reset — and the REST bulk-update
  endpoint); `mcp/factory.py` 76% → 92% (the update/delete MCP tool handlers);
  `crud.py` 78% → 84% (the HTML bulk-action + bulk-update-form views);
  `audit.py` 57% → 80% (the `log_write` never-raises discipline).

## [0.15.0] - 2026-08-09

### Changed
- **BREAKING — CRUDViews require login by default.** `CRUDView.mixins` now
  defaults to `None`, which the framework resolves to `[LoginRequiredMixin]`;
  previously the default was `[]` (anonymous). A CRUDView that *omitted* `mixins`
  silently shipped public HTML **and** REST endpoints — now it requires login.
  Opt into anonymous access with the new **`public = True`** flag (or an explicit
  `mixins = []`); an explicit `mixins` list always wins. A public view that
  exposes write actions with `enable_api=True` now emits a warning. All bundled
  framework views set `mixins` explicitly and are unaffected. See
  [`UPGRADING.md`](UPGRADING.md). (Codebase-review F6.)

### Added
- **`make typecheck`** — mypy + django-stubs, configured leniently and scoped to
  the type-clean apps (starts at `apps/feeds`; widen app-by-app as each reaches
  green). A local / pre-commit guard, no CI lane. (Codebase-review F3.)

### Removed
- **django-debug-toolbar** — removed from the project entirely (dependency, the
  dev-settings toggle, the `__debug__/` URL, and the bundled help page). It was
  off-by-default dev tooling; dropping it slims the dependency surface.

## [0.14.3] - 2026-08-09

Fixes from a full codebase review (two security fixes + a Django 6.1 deploy-check
regression). All backward-compatible.

### Fixed
- **Security — stored XSS on public search snippets.** Dropped `|safe` on the
  website search result snippet (`templates/website/search.html`); the value is
  raw model text and the view is anonymous, so it's now auto-escaped.
- **Security — PKCE code-challenge compared in constant time.** `verify_pkce`
  (`apps/mcp/oauth.py`) now uses `hmac.compare_digest` instead of `==`.
- **Fresh-clone `manage.py check --deploy` passes again.** Django 6.1's
  `mail.E001` deploy check errored on dev's console email backend; it's now
  silenced in development settings (dev isn't a deploy target — production/SMTP
  is unaffected and still validated). Regression from the v0.14.2 / Django 6.1
  MAILERS migration.

### Removed
- **Dead search abstraction layer** — `apps/search/{api,orchestration,cache,serializers}.py`
  (813 lines with no runtime importers; runtime search goes through
  `get_backend()` directly). Removing it also eliminates a latent
  `SearchAPI.search()` access-gate bypass.

### Internal
- Test integrity + coverage: replaced hollow `api_doctor` tests with a real
  fail-case assertion, restored the SearchBuilder-example + search-admin tests,
  and added audit-logging failure-path tests (`audit.py` 57% → 80%). Documented
  the help-renderer trust boundary.

## [0.14.2] - 2026-08-09

### Fixed
- **Absolute URLs are `https://` behind kamal-proxy.** The base `production.py`
  shipped without `SECURE_PROXY_SSL_HEADER`, so behind the TLS-terminating proxy
  (which forwards over HTTP) `request.is_secure()` was False and Django built
  `http://` absolute URLs — feed self-links, sitemaps, and the links in
  password-reset / invite emails all went out as http. Now sets
  `SECURE_PROXY_SSL_HEADER = ("HTTP_X_FORWARDED_PROTO", "https")`, **gated on the
  existing `TRUST_PROXY_HEADERS` flag** (default-on in production). Safe by
  default for non-proxy deployments: a directly-exposed instance
  (`TRUST_PROXY_HEADERS=false`) never trusts a client-supplied `X-Forwarded-Proto`.

## [0.14.1] - 2026-08-09

Two upstream bug fixes surfaced by a downstream deploy.

### Fixed
- **Docker builds install from the frozen `uv.lock`.** The `Dockerfile` copied
  `uv.lock` but installed with `uv pip install -e .`, which re-resolves the
  `pyproject.toml` ranges (`django>=6.1`, …) against the index at build time and
  ignores the lock — so images could silently drift onto newer, untested
  dependency releases (a routine deploy pulling a future Django and breaking on
  an incompatible transitive dep, with nothing changed in the repo). Now exports
  the frozen lock and installs that exact set, then the project with `--no-deps`.
  Builds are reproducible (prod == local == CI) and fail loudly if `uv.lock`
  drifts from `pyproject.toml`. Verified via an image build.
- **`mcp_doctor` no longer false-positives on `enable_mcp = True` in strings.**
  The unregistered-opt-in scan was a naive substring match that fired on the
  marker inside docstrings/seed content (the runbook seed command embeds a
  teaching example), turning `mcp_doctor` and the dashboard MCP card yellow over
  a non-issue. It now uses AST detection — the marker counts only as a real
  `ClassDef`-body assignment. `mcp_doctor` goes 6✓/1⚠ → 7✓/0⚠.

## [0.14.0] - 2026-08-08

Django 6.1 + the email `MAILERS` migration. Minor bump because the email change
is **breaking for downstream projects that set `EMAIL_BACKEND`** in their own
settings (see UPGRADING). Also the first published release to carry the
accessibility foundation and the RSS/Atom feeds surface from v0.13.13.

### Changed
- **Django 6.0 → 6.1** (latest stable). `manage.py check` clean and the full
  suite passes; every third-party dependency (axes, csp, filter, htmx,
  tasks-db, cors-headers, debug-toolbar, extensions, whitenoise, mcp) is
  compatible unchanged.
- **Email migrated to Django 6.1's `MAILERS`.** The framework now ships a
  `MAILERS` dict (assembled from the same `EMAIL_*` **environment variables**
  via `config/settings/_email.py`) instead of the deprecated flat `EMAIL_*`
  *settings*, and drops the deprecated `fail_silently` argument across all mail
  calls. This clears every `RemovedInDjango70Warning`. `DEFAULT_FROM_EMAIL` /
  `SERVER_EMAIL` and `send_mail` / `EmailMultiAlternatives` / `mail_admins` are
  unchanged. **Breaking:** Django 6.1 raises `ImproperlyConfigured` if a
  deprecated `EMAIL_*` setting coexists with `MAILERS` — downstream projects
  that define `EMAIL_BACKEND` must migrate (UPGRADING.md).

### Fixed
- Accessibility WCAG 2.1 AA follow-ups across the theme, CRUD tables, and the
  feeds surfaces (sortable headers became real `<button>`s with `aria-sort`,
  focus and labelling polish).
- Feeds: enforce the `SMALLSTACK_FEEDS_ENABLED` master switch on the request
  surface, Django-6 enclosure handling, and consume-side auth headers.
- Test suite: silenced pre-existing naive-datetime and unclosed-file
  `ResourceWarning` noise (no behavior change).

## [0.13.13] - 2026-08-08

Two new surfaces — first-party RSS/Atom feeds and an accessibility foundation —
both built as reusable, documented primitives with the "fix once in the
framework, every project benefits" model.

### Added
- **RSS/Atom feeds (`apps.feeds`)** — a symmetric publish + consume surface,
  mirroring the webhooks philosophy. **Publish**: ``enable_rss = True`` on a
  CRUDView exposes it at ``/feed/<slug>.rss`` (+ ``.atom``), deriving items from
  the existing ``search_display``/``search_subtitle``/timestamp/detail-route
  declarations; curated feeds subclass ``Feed`` + ``register_feed``. Access is
  gated by ``SearchAccess`` (anonymous/authenticated/staff; token via Bearer or
  ``?token=``). The ``rss_item_extra(obj)`` seam attaches enclosures/iTunes tags
  so media/podcast feeds are a downstream add-on, not core. **Consume**:
  ``register_feed_source(name, url, model=, map=, dedupe=)`` + a dependency-free
  RSS 2.0/Atom parser + a collector that runs as ``manage.py collect_feeds`` and
  a ``@scheduled`` poll job (idempotent, deduped), landing in a bundled
  ``CollectedItem`` model or your own. The public status page publishes an
  incidents-plus-maintenance feed at ``/feed/status.rss`` as the reference.
  Skill: ``docs/skills/rss.md``.
- **Accessibility primitives** — reusable building blocks: ``.sr-only``,
  ``.skip-link``, a global ``:focus-visible`` ring, and
  ``window.SmallStack.trapFocus(el)`` (used by the stat modal + omnibar). Skill:
  ``docs/skills/accessibility.md`` (primitives, rules, pre-"done" checklist),
  wired into the read-first guides so agents build accessibly by default.

### Fixed
- **Accessibility (WCAG 2.1 AA) gaps across the theme** — keyboard focus rings
  on form inputs (previously ``outline: none`` with no ``:focus-visible``
  replacement, a 2.4.7 blocker); a skip-to-content link; form errors announced
  via ``role="alert"``; ``<th scope>`` + ``aria-sort`` on CRUD tables; modal
  ``role="dialog"``/``aria-modal``/labelled close + focus trap; and
  ``aria-hidden`` on the decorative SVGs in the shared topbar/sidebar/user-menu.

## [0.13.12] - 2026-08-08

Postgres out-of-the-box hardening for search, upstreamed from a downstream
post-mortem (search worked in dev SQLite, then broke and crawled on prod
Postgres). SQLite masks each of these, so the fix is making the Postgres path
good by default. All backward-compatible; verified on SQLite and a real
Postgres 16.

### Added
- **`reindex_instances(model, objects=None)`** (`apps.search`) — reindex rows
  written by `bulk_create` / `bulk_update` / `QuerySet.update()`, which fire no
  signals and were otherwise left **silently un-indexed** (the most common
  importer/data-migration footgun).
- **Search diagnostics** — `manage.py search_diagnose [query]` and a staff page
  at `/smallstack/search/diagnostics/` share one core: per-table health (est.
  rows, GIN present, un-indexed backlog), app-level timing, and a live
  `EXPLAIN` verdict (Seq Scan vs GIN Bitmap Index Scan, size-aware so it doesn't
  cry wolf on small tables). Answers "is search fast, and if not, where's the
  time" when you can't reach `psql`.
- **`analyze_search_index` management command** — refreshes Postgres planner
  stats for every searchable table (cheap, fast, safe on every deploy; wired
  into the container entrypoint). No-op on SQLite.
- **Help full-text search on Postgres** — both the article index (omnibar /
  `search_help`) and the passage-level RAG index behind the `search_help_docs`
  MCP tool now build a `tsvector`+GIN index on Postgres instead of falling back
  to a Python scan (which returned **empty** for the RAG tool on prod).
- **`digits_search()`** (`apps.search`) — recipe/helper for indexing opaque
  identifiers (phone numbers, SKUs) that the `english` FTS tokenizer won't
  match on partial/formatted input.

### Changed
- **Postgres `rebuild_search_index` is now set-based** — one
  `UPDATE … setweight(to_tsvector(…)) || …` for views whose `search_fields` are
  all local columns (seconds instead of O(rows) per-row UPDATEs); per-row
  fallback retained for property/`__`-related fields. Runs `ANALYZE` afterward.
- **GIN indexes are created `CONCURRENTLY`** on Postgres (autocommit-guarded) so
  provisioning never locks a live table; provisioning failures are surfaced
  rather than only logged.
- **Search-hub row counts use the planner's `reltuples` estimate** on Postgres
  instead of `COUNT(*)` per model (instant catalog lookup vs full scan).

### Fixed
- **Help docs were re-parsed from disk on every request.** `build_search_index()`
  is now memoized (`@lru_cache`); on Postgres, where help search fell back to a
  scan, this took the hot path from ~4.5 s to ~15 ms (~300×).
- **Search results are clickable without `get_absolute_url`.** Hits fall back to
  the registering CRUDView's `{url_base}-detail` route.
- **Changing `search_fields` no longer breaks SQLite search.** FTS5 bakes one
  column per field at create time; the table is now detected as drifted and
  recreated (previously `rebuild_search_index` failed with "table … has no
  column named …").
- **`api_view` no longer force-parses multipart/form bodies as JSON.** File
  uploads to custom API endpoints returned 400 "Invalid JSON" because the
  decorator read `request.body` and demanded JSON for every write method.
  Multipart and form-encoded content types now skip JSON parsing
  (`request.json` is `None`; use `request.POST`/`request.FILES` as usual).
- **Bare-button hover styling no longer outranks custom button classes.** The
  base `button` / `input[type=submit|button]` rules put only the wrapper inside
  `:where()`, so `button:hover` still carried (0,1,1) specificity — enough to
  beat a downstream single-class button (0,1,0) on hover and slide the
  `--primary-hover` background under its custom text color (low-contrast
  accent-on-accent hovers). The entire selector now sits inside `:where()`
  (true zero specificity, all states), matching the rule's stated intent.
  Downstream apps that added defensive per-state `background` declarations can
  keep or drop them; they are now redundant.

## [0.13.11] - 2026-07-29

### Added
- **Datasets — bucketed grouping + drilldown** (R8, the final datasets-feedback
  item). `series()` now accepts a **dict** dimension for bucketed grouping:
  numeric bands (`{lo, hi}`, half-open), categorical (`{value}` / `{values}`),
  an honest `{other: true}` complement, and **auto** top-N value buckets keyed
  `v:<value>` (+ `other`) derived from the unnarrowed scope so keys stay stable
  under filters. Count-only (`[{key, label, value, lo, hi}]`). A `rows(dimension=,
  bucket=)` **drilldown** re-applies the same bucket condition, so the rows behind
  a bucket reconcile with its count by construction. Exposed over REST (JSON
  `buckets` / `auto` params, `bucket=` drilldown) and MCP (`buckets` array, `auto`,
  `bucket`). The bucket grammar (`apps/datasets/buckets.py`) is lifted verbatim
  from the downstream reporter so call_stats can swap to it.

## [0.13.10] - 2026-07-29

### Added
- **Datasets hardening** (from downstream feedback):
  - `@dataset(filterable=…)` replaces `filters=` for the *declaration* of which
    columns may be filtered; the old `filters=` decorator kwarg is a deprecated
    alias (warns). Runtime `rows()/series()/scalar()(filters=…)` is unchanged.
  - Public **`ds.queryset(request, filters)`** seam so a higher layer (a BI/report
    layer) can compose on a dataset's filtered queryset without touching internals.
  - **Pagination**: `rows(limit, offset)` (+ `limit=None` for the whole set) and
    `ds.count()`; the REST rows route returns an envelope `{count, total, offset,
    results}` and CSV exports the whole filtered set.
  - **Declared ratio measures**: `@dataset(measures=[(name, num, denom, fmt)])`
    computes `sum(num)/sum(denom)` in-DB per group (`×100` for percent), returning
    `None` for an empty denominator — never the average of per-row ratios. Surfaced
    in `schema()` (`computed: true`) and the MCP tool.
  - **Explicit date ranges**: `<col>__gte` / `<col>__lt` half-open bounds on any
    date/datetime column, everywhere filters are accepted (explicit wins over a
    preset); `schema()` advertises `"range": true`.
- Datasets app **label namespaced** to `smallstack_datasets` (avoids an
  `INSTALLED_APPS` clash with a downstream app named `datasets`).
- Docs: naming guidance + the flat-filter invariant documented in `datasets.md`.

## [0.13.9] - 2026-07-29

### Added
- **Datasets (`apps/datasets/`)** — the `@dataset` primitive: register a filtered
  queryset as a named, typed source of rows/columns for dashboard/report/chart
  UIs. `schema()` introspects it into dimensions/measures + filter widgets;
  `rows()` returns tabular data (FK columns are a bare pk by default, `id`+`name`
  on expand), `series()` aggregates a measure over a dimension (resolving FK
  dimension labels to name), and a **scalar** mode returns a single aggregate
  (count / sum) when no dimension is given. Opt-in REST + MCP: a `query_dataset`
  tool (series + scalar, honoring filters) and JSON endpoints (anonymous → 401).
  Unknown dimension/measure raise a clear `ValueError`. See `docs/skills/datasets.md`.
- **Help RAG** — a lexical passage index over the bundled help docs plus a
  `search_help_docs` MCP tool, so AI clients can retrieve relevant doc passages.

## [0.13.8] - 2026-07-26

### Added
- **Webhooks (`apps/webhooks/`)** — outbound event delivery and inbound receivers,
  built on the CRUDView pipeline. A model opts into **outbound** with
  `enable_webhooks = True` (like `enable_search`); a global `post_save`/`post_delete`
  observer fans every change — across HTML, REST, MCP, `sc`, and raw ORM — out to
  matching `WebhookEndpoint`s as an HMAC-SHA256-signed POST, delivered through the
  `django.tasks` queue with exponential backoff, **`Retry-After`** support,
  auto-disable, a dead-letter state, and **bulk replay**. **Inbound**: a
  `WebhookReceiver` + a `@webhook_handler` verify the signature (constant-time) and
  dispatch. Ships an SSRF guard, staff-only secret reveal/rotate, a
  `/smallstack/webhooks/` dashboard, a status monitor, `webhook_doctor`, `sc webhook`
  ops, and MCP tools.
- **Webhook extension seams** — four named-registry hooks (`@webhook_transform`,
  `@webhook_auth`, `@webhook_verifier`, `@webhook_challenge`), autodiscovered from an
  app's `webhook_*.py` and each defaulting to the built-in behavior, so a specific
  integration (Slack payloads, Stripe/GitHub/SNS signatures, SAS/OIDC auth, Event Grid
  validation) is a small plug-in rather than a core change. A complete **Azure Event
  Grid** reference adapter (`apps/webhooks/contrib/eventgrid.py`) is built purely on
  the seams with zero core edits.
- **SmallStack↔SmallStack pairing** — `sc webhook pair` stands up a loop-safe two-way
  link in one command (paired endpoint + receiver with per-direction secrets, a
  `suppress_webhooks()` loop guard, and an `X-SmallStack-Origin` header so write-backs
  can't run away). A stable `X-SmallStack-Event-Id` lets consumers dedupe across
  retries and operator replay.

## [0.13.7] - 2026-07-25

### Fixed
- **CRUD list "N Records" count** — the record count lives in the toolbar, outside
  the `#crud-list-content` htmx swap target, so a search/filter left it showing the
  stale pre-filter total. The list-content response now emits an out-of-band copy
  of the count span (`hx-swap-oob`) so it refreshes alongside the list — no extra
  request, no JS. Guarded by `request.htmx` so a full-page load (which includes the
  partial in-page) doesn't render a duplicate. The `tokenmgr` app, which overrides
  the generic list-content partial, gets the same out-of-band refresh.

## [0.13.6] - 2026-07-21

### Added
- **Scheduler (`apps/scheduler/`)** — recurring background jobs over `django.tasks`
  (no Celery/Redis). Ships the `@scheduled` decorator (cron / interval / once,
  with calendar-aware intervals and anchors), DB-backed `ScheduledJob` schedules
  with idempotent code-sync, and a `run_due_jobs` tick with an **atomic claim**
  so concurrent triggers can't double-fire. Overlap guard (with a stale-run
  timeout so a dead worker can't wedge a schedule), catch-up policy, and run
  history linked to the task engine's `DBTaskResult`.
- **Scheduler surfaces** — themed `/smallstack/scheduler/` dashboard (stat cards,
  24h run timeline, upcoming + recent runs, per-job Run-now), a `ScheduledJob`
  CRUDView with REST (`enable_api`) + MCP (`list_schedules` … `delete_schedule`)
  + search, a dashboard widget, a `/status/` core monitor, and Explorer browsing.
- **Scheduler control UI** — the jobs list gains a table⇄calendar toggle (upcoming
  runs by next fire) plus a read-only **run-history** view with its own
  table⇄calendar coloured by outcome. Code-owned jobs render as a **read-only
  control page**: the definition is locked to code; operators override only the
  schedule + enable/pause + Run-now. UI schedule overrides survive code-sync
  (`schedule_overridden`), with a "reset to code default".
- **Triggers** — `POST /smallstack/scheduler/tick/` (localhost-only, runs inside
  gunicorn), `manage.py run_due_tasks`, `manage.py scheduler_beat`; plus
  `manage.py prune_job_runs` history retention. Cron lines added to
  `scripts/smallstack-cron`.
- **Focus mode** on Help & Docs and Runbook now also collapses the SmallStack side
  menu for an immersive read (non-persistent; restored on Expand). `theme.js`
  exposes `window.smallstackSidebar` (get/set state with a persist opt-out).
- Settings: `SMALLSTACK_SCHEDULER_ENABLED`, `_STALE_RUN_SECONDS`,
  `_OVERDUE_GRACE_SECONDS`, `_FAILURE_EMAILS`. New dependency: `croniter`.
- Docs: `docs/skills/scheduler.md`; `@scheduled` flipped from "coming soon" to
  shipped in `CLAUDE.md`, `README.md`, `background-tasks.md`, `skills/README.md`.

### Changed
- **Runbook markdown** now renders with the same recipe as Help & Docs (roomier
  18px/1.8 prose, heading rules, neutral non-accent-tinted code inset into the
  card) — fixes the long-standing readability gap between the two surfaces.
- **Orange palette** retuned to a warm-ground "quiet luxury" look (vivid accent,
  warm-biased surfaces); the elegance levers are documented in `modify-palettes.md`.
- User-menu **"Admin"** now opens the SmallStack dashboard (`/smallstack/`) rather
  than raw Django admin (still reachable from the sidebar "Admin Panel").

### Fixed
- Scheduler hardening: timezone dev/prod parity (Linux/Docker), recompute + monitor
  sample-floor tuning, and agent-hostile input hardening.

## [0.13.5] - 2026-07-19

### Fixed
- **SQLiteFTSBackend.rebuild() deadlock** — Fixed "database is locked" error on models with >500 rows. 
  Root cause: iterator(chunk_size=500) kept read cursor open during writes. Solution: materialize pk list, 
  batch with explicit transactions. Approximately 50x faster; tested with 25,713+ rows.
- **SearchBuilder.transform_hit() call convention** — Fixed silent failure where custom variants returned 
  empty extra payload. Root cause: instance method called unbound on class (TypeError swallowed). 
  Solution: instantiate view before calling, matching pattern elsewhere. Enhanced error logging to 
  document contract.
- **PostgresFTSBackend.rebuild()** — Applied same deadlock fix as SQLite (consistent batching pattern).

### Documentation
- Added fixes/DOWNSTREAM-ISSUES.md documenting both bugs, root causes, and fixes.
- Clarified that filter_searchable_queryset and get_ranking_weights are dead code in v0.13.4; 
  use search_weight and post-filtering instead.

### Backward Compatible
- No API changes
- All fixes are transparent to downstream apps
- Required for any model with >500 rows + enable_search, or custom SearchBuilder.transform_hit()


## [0.13.4] - 2026-07-18

### Added
- **SearchBuilder — programmable search customization** (Phases 1-2, ~3,500 LOC): Optional SearchBuilder protocol 
  enables models to define custom search variants (admin, public, api, mcp, etc.) with computed fields, custom 
  display logic, cross-model orchestration, and automatic MCP tool generation per variant. Native dict serialization 
  (no DRF dependency). Full type hints and comprehensive testing.
- **Native search serialization** — 4 pure-Python dict functions (`serialize_search_hit`, `serialize_search_results`, 
  `serialize_search_config`, `serialize_all_search_configs`) for JSON-safe output. Supports variant-specific extra fields 
  with transparent flattening.
- **Search introspection API** — `SearchAPI` class with 5 methods (get_config, list_variants, search, search_and_filter, 
  get_output_schema) for high-level orchestration; `SearchOrchestrator` for multi-stage workflows and cross-model search.
- **Search variant caching** — In-memory config cache with 1-hour TTL and cache invalidation on view registration.
- **Per-variant MCP tools** — Auto-generated MCP tools for each search variant (search_model, search_model_summary, 
  search_model_admin, etc.) for agent orchestration.

### Fixed
- **F1 (BLOCKER)** — Instance method call on class; fixed by instantiating view_cls before calling get_search_variants().
- **F2 (MAJOR)** — Removed djangorestframework dependency; replaced with 4 native dict serialization functions.
- **F4 (MAJOR)** — Guarded 3 unguarded date_joined references in search examples; added missing email field to admin variant.
- **F5 (MAJOR)** — Fixed 252 ruff lint errors (226 W293 whitespace, 16 F401 unused imports, 9 I001 unsorted, 1 E501 line length).
- **F6 (MAJOR)** — Replaced broken DRF serializer tests with real native serializer tests; removed false pytest.skip guards.
- **F7 (OBSERVATION)** — Documented extra field flattening behavior and collision risk in serialize_search_hit() docstring.

### Technical Details
- All new code is fully typed (Python 3.10+ syntax: dict[str, Any], QuerySet, return types)
- 119 integration tests covering all variants, orchestration, caching, and admin integration
- Comprehensive documentation: RUNBOOK.md, TUTORIAL.md, ORCHESTRATION-GUIDE.md, and 2 AI skills
- Backward compatible: all SearchBuilder methods optional; existing search works unchanged
- No breaking changes to SearchBackend protocol or query() signature


## [0.13.3] - 2026-07-16

### Fixed
- **Runbook dark-mode CSS** — enhanced styling now correctly scoped to app theme (`html[data-theme="dark"]`) 
  instead of OS setting (`@media prefers-color-scheme`), ensuring enhancements apply on default dark mode 
  regardless of OS theme setting.
- **Seeder idempotency** — `seed_platform_runbook` command now properly assigns section before guard check, 
  preventing `IntegrityError` crashes on re-run; added comprehensive idempotency test.

## [0.13.2] - 2026-07-12

### Added
- **`sc` — a framework CLI** (`manage.py sc` / the `sc` console script): a fifth thin skin over the
  CRUDView registry, the same operations as web/REST/MCP. Resource verbs — `ls` (registered models +
  rows, with `-q`/`--filter`/`--order`/`--limit`), `get`, `describe`, `search`, and writes `new`/`set`/
  `rm` through the model's `form_class` validation + `log_write` audit (staff-gated like the MCP tools).
  Operational verbs — `doctor`/`backup`/`token`/`status`/`index` (thin fronts over the framework's
  management commands) plus `sc commands` discovery. `--json` on every read. Explorer-synthesized views
  mean it reaches every admin-registered model, not just hand-written CRUDViews. See
  `docs/skills/sc-cli.md`.

### Fixed
- **Bundled JS client** (`clients/js` v0.3.1): SSR-safe `localStorage` access — the client guards
  `localStorage` so it's safe to import in a server-side-rendering context.

## [0.13.1] - 2026-07-12

### Added
- **Bundled API clients** under `clients/`: a TypeScript/JavaScript SDK (`clients/js`, with built
  `dist/`) and a single-file Python client (`clients/python/smallstack_client.py`) for talking to the
  REST API from external apps. See `clients/README.md`.

## [0.13.0] - 2026-07-12

### Added
- **Runbook — a first-class dynamic-documents app** (`apps/runbook/`): versioned markdown documents
  with images, sections, keyword + full-text search, retention, subscriptions, and portable ZIP
  bundles — readable and writable from the web UI, a transport-agnostic service layer, REST, MCP,
  and a unix-style CLI. (Previously the standalone `smallstack-runbook` package; now permanent core.
  The `smallstack_runbook` DB label is preserved, so existing tables/migrations reuse as-is.)
- **Runbook CLI** (`manage.py runbook` / the `rb` console script): `ls`, `toc`, `find` (BM25-ranked
  search), `cat` (`<ref>@N` reads an earlier version), `write` (stdin), `cp`, `rm`, `restore`, `mv`,
  `revert`, `log`, `stat`, `mkdir`, `sections`, `publish`/`unpublish`. Every verb takes `--json`.
- **Runbook REST API**: full document lifecycle (`api/documents/…`, incl. `append`/`move`/`archive`/
  `unarchive`/`revert`/`copy`) plus an `api/runbooks/…` container resource (list/create, detail +
  table of contents, sections, publish/unpublish). All registered in the OpenAPI schema (Swagger/
  ReDoc) and ownership-scoped. `GET api/documents/?q=` is BM25-ranked (substring fallback).
- **Runbook MCP tools** + search-engine registration (`search_runbook_documents`, global omnibar).
- **Runbook dashboard widget** on the central `/smallstack/` dashboard (runbook + document counts).
- `api_doctor` now lists hand-registered (`register_api_path`) custom endpoints, so its inventory
  matches the OpenAPI schema (and warns on any `url_name` that no longer reverses).

### Changed
- Client-IP resolution is now proxy-aware and shared by the activity log and the django-axes login
  lockout. Behind a trusted reverse proxy (`TRUST_PROXY_HEADERS`, defaulted on in production for
  kamal-proxy) the real client is read from the rightmost, proxy-appended `X-Forwarded-For` entry
  (spoof-resistant); otherwise the unspoofable `REMOTE_ADDR` is used. One helper
  (`apps/smallstack/client_ip.py`) is the single source of truth.
- The markdown hardening from the CRUD field-preview is extracted into a reusable
  `harden_markdown_renderer()` and shared with the runbook renderer.

### Fixed
- **Stored XSS in runbook document rendering** — user- and AI-authored document bodies could inject
  `<script>` / `<img onerror>` / `javascript:` links that executed in a viewer's session. The
  renderer now escapes raw HTML and blanks dangerous URL schemes, and drops the unsafe `md_in_html`
  and `attr_list` extensions. Regression-tested.
- Runbook ZIP export silently omitted section-less ("loose") documents attached straight to a
  runbook — they are now included (loose docs at the archive root).
- Runbook CLI N+1 queries in `ls`, `toc`, and `sections`.
- MCP activity page: the filter `Apply`/`Reset` buttons now align with the control row.
- Silenced the django-axes INFO startup banner in development (it polluted piped CLI output).

### Security
- django-axes now resolves the real client IP behind kamal-proxy, so per-IP brute-force lockout is
  effective in production (previously every request keyed to the proxy's address, neutering it).

## [0.12.4] - 2026-07-11

### Security
- **Dependencies:** bumped Django (→6.0.7), Pillow (→12.3.0), starlette, pydantic-settings, pygments,
  and pytest to their fix releases — `pip-audit` goes from 13 known vulnerabilities to 0.
- Fixed stored-XSS in the CRUD field-preview markdown renderer — arbitrary field content can no
  longer inject script. Raw HTML is neutralized (rendered as escaped text), dangerous link/image
  URL schemes (`javascript:`, `data:`, …) are blanked via a URL allowlist, and the extension set
  is restricted to `fenced_code`/`tables` (no `md_in_html` / `attr_list`). Regression-tested.
- Fixed stored-XSS in search-result snippets — the plain-text snippet is no longer rendered `|safe`.
- CSP: added `base-uri 'self'` and `object-src 'none'` directives (no inline-script trade-off).

### Added
- `register_api_path` — let custom `@api_view` endpoints join the OpenAPI schema.
- Maintenance-window tooling for heartbeat/status: `manage.py maintenance` command and
  `apps/heartbeat/maintenance.py` (open a maintenance window / SLA-exclude a deploy).
- Per-app `README.md` files, plus `SECURITY.md` and this `CHANGELOG.md`.

### Fixed
- Ordering by a computed/non-DB column no longer 500s — a misconfigured `ordering_fields` (or a
  hand-crafted `?ordering=`) degrades to no-sort instead of raising `FieldError`.
- Search: a model registered *after* the search app's `ready()` (from a later app in
  `INSTALLED_APPS`) now gets its per-model `search_<plural>` MCP tool — registration is now
  independent of app order.
- OpenAPI `info.version` and `MCP_SERVER_VERSION` derive from the package version (new
  `SMALLSTACK_VERSION` setting) instead of a hardcoded `1.0.0`.
- Dev `SECRET_KEY` is persisted to a gitignored `.secret_key` so all local processes share one key —
  `screenshot_auth` sessions are no longer silently rejected on a fresh clone.

### Changed
- API-layer dedup: `json.loads` bodies via `_load_json_body`; the three HTML-pagination sites via
  `attach_display_helpers`; `_api_list` and the OpenAPI path builders slimmed via extracted helpers.
- Heartbeat: six function-based views moved to a shared `staff_required` decorator.
- Type hints completed on `apps/activity`, `apps/tasks`, `apps/profile`, and `apps/smallstack/displays.py`;
  narrowed/logged several broad `except` handlers.
- Standardized test layout (`accounts`/`heartbeat` → `tests/` packages); `apps/tasks` coverage 0% → 99%.
- Docs: unified "Coming soon" framing for `@scheduled` + vector search; completed the CLI reference.

## [0.12.3] - 2026

### Fixed
- Invisible status calendar/timeline cells on standalone status pages.

## [0.12.2] - 2026

### Changed
- Maintenance-aware status: uptime/SLA calculations exclude scheduled maintenance windows.

### Fixed
- Test-suite robustness improvements.

## [0.12.1] - 2026

### Added
- `merge-0.12.0` upgrade skill documenting the v0.12.0 migration path.

## [0.12.0] - 2026

### Added
- **Pluggable status monitoring system** — register a Service + Monitor to track a
  subsystem's uptime/health on `/smallstack/status/`; add status visualizations.
  See `docs/skills/status-monitors.md`.

### Changed
- MCP and Search are decoupled from the status system (independent enable flags).
- Daily-timeline "today" coloring and doctor-command flag-awareness fixes.

### Removed
- **django-tables2** and the public `apps.smallstack.tables` / `table_class` surface.
  Downstream projects importing these must migrate — see `UPGRADING.md`.

## [0.11.x] - 2026

Condensed highlights of the v0.11 series (see git history for per-patch detail):

### Added
- Account invites by email + passwordless code login with branded emails (`apps/accounts`).
- Username-or-email login (`EmailOrUsernameBackend`).
- `usermanager`: password-on-create, edit actions, and guardrails.
- Consolidated dashboard stat cards into one `{% stat_card %}` standard with drill-down modals.
- API endpoints admin page; clickable list rows; table pagination.
- Editorial "Getting Started" redesign; apps-dropdown redesign; Search section on Home.

### Fixed
- **v0.11.14** — pinned test settings to `config.settings.test` (`--ds` in `addopts`) so the
  suite no longer silently ran under dev settings; hermetic dev-superuser test; v0.12 upgrade note.
- **v0.11.13** — platform re-audit hardening: security fixes (OAuth scope→role capping, token
  scope, backups, allowed hosts), Postgres fixes, **GitHub Actions CI** (SQLite + Postgres matrix
  + ruff), and the django-tables2 removal groundwork.
- Django-6 `log_action` breakage that broke programmatic API/MCP write audit logging.
- Explorer detail grid rendering every boolean as ✓ regardless of value.
