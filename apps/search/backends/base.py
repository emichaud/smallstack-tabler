"""SearchBackend protocol — the contract every backend implements.

Three backends ship with SmallStack: SQLiteFTSBackend (FTS5 virtual
tables, BM25 ranking), PostgresFTSBackend (SearchVectorField + GIN +
ts_rank), and FallbackBackend (__icontains OR for everything else).

The user-facing API is identical across backends — write a single
CRUDView with ``enable_search = True`` and the right backend wires up
based on your configured database engine.
