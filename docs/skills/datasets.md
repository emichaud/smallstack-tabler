# Datasets — filtered querysets as typed rows & columns (`@dataset`)

**Read this** before building anything that needs "a table of rows the user can slice and chart" — a dashboard builder, a report picker, an export screen, or an MCP/agent that queries structured data. A **dataset** is a named function returning a `QuerySet`; the framework turns it into typed rows + columns you can inspect, filter, and roll up **without knowing the underlying model**. That introspection is the whole point: you build the UI against the *schema*, not against a specific table.

> **Prerequisites**: [`modern-dark-theme.md`](modern-dark-theme.md) for the page/component patterns, [`building-a-user-facing-site.md`](building-a-user-facing-site.md) if the surface is non-staff.

## The one-paragraph model

Declare a dataset with `@dataset` over a queryset. The base derives everything a UI needs from `qs.model`: **column names, datatypes, a dimension/measure role, and ready-made filter widgets**. A visual builder then: lists datasets → reads one dataset's schema → offers field/filter pickers → asks for filtered `rows` or a grouped `series`. The builder is generic — it never hard-codes a model. Base ships **zero** datasets; you (or a downstream project) declare them.

## Declare a dataset

```python
from apps.datasets import dataset

@dataset("open_tickets", label="Open Tickets",
         description="Tickets still awaiting resolution",
         enable_api=True, enable_mcp=True)   # both default False
def open_tickets(request=None):
    return Ticket.objects.filter(status="open").select_related("assignee")
```

- The function takes **zero args or one `request`** (for per-user scoping). It returns a queryset — no model class, no CRUDView, no migration.
- Put it in any app's `datasets.py` — it's autodiscovered at startup and self-registers (zero wiring), exactly like a CRUDView in `views.py`.
- Flags are opt-in: `enable_api` publishes REST routes, `enable_mcp` publishes an agent tool. Neither is required — a dataset is useful in-process with neither flag set.

Key + flags reference:

| Arg | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `key` (required) | Stable id used in URLs / tool names (`query_dataset_<key>`) |
| `label`, `description` | Human text shown in the picker + tool description |
| `enable_api` | Publish `GET /smallstack/datasets/<key>/…` (staff-gated) |
| `enable_mcp` | Publish a `query_dataset_<key>` MCP tool; `mcp_access` sets the tier (default `"staff"`) |
| `filterable` | Restrict which columns MAY be filtered (default: all). *(The old `filters=` decorator kwarg is a deprecated alias — still works, warns.)* |
| `columns` | Override the column list — needed only for annotations (see [Computed columns](#computed-columns)) |
| `measures` | Declared ratio measures `[(name, numerator, denominator, fmt)]` computed as sum/sum (see [Declared ratio measures](#declared-ratio-measures)) |

> **`filterable` (declaration) vs `filters` (runtime) — two different things.** `@dataset(filterable=["status"])` says *which* columns may be filtered. `ds.rows(filters={"status": "open"})` passes the *active* filter values. The runtime `filters=` on `rows()/series()/scalar()` keeps its name.

## Naming — `dataset` is reserved

`dataset` is standard BI vocabulary, so it's tempting to reuse — don't. This framework primitive owns the generic noun; **name your domain things specifically** so nothing collides with it (in code, app labels, or URLs):

- a metric glossary → `MetricDefinition` (not `DataSet`)
- a saved chart/query definition → a "query" (not a "dataset")
- a raw-export folder → `source_exports/` (not `datasets/`)

The framework app is labelled `smallstack_datasets` precisely so a downstream app *can* still be labelled `datasets` without an `INSTALLED_APPS` clash — but keeping the concept-name clear avoids confusion regardless.

## The four operations a UI is built from

```python
from apps.datasets.core import list_datasets, get_dataset

list_datasets()                       # picker list: [{key, label, description}]
ds = get_dataset("open_tickets")
ds.schema()                           # typed columns + filter widgets  ← build the UI from this
ds.rows(filters={"status": "open"})   # reduced rows: [ {col: val, ...}, ... ]
ds.series("assignee", measure="hours_spent", agg="sum")   # [{label, value}] for bar/pie
ds.scalar(measure="hours_spent", agg="sum")               # one number for a KPI tile (no GROUP BY)
```

Over HTTP the same operations are:

```
GET /smallstack/datasets/                       → list
GET /smallstack/datasets/<key>/schema/          → schema
GET /smallstack/datasets/<key>/?<field>=<val>   → rows (query params are filters)
GET /smallstack/datasets/<key>/?format=csv      → rows as a CSV download (text/csv attachment)
GET /smallstack/datasets/<key>/series/?dimension=assignee&measure=hours_spent&agg=sum
GET /smallstack/datasets/<key>/scalar/?measure=hours_spent&agg=sum   → {value} for a KPI tile
```

`scalar()` (and the `/scalar/` route, or `/series/` with no `dimension`) is an ungrouped `qs.aggregate()` — one DB round-trip, one number. `agg="count"` or no `measure` counts rows; an empty set yields `0`.

### Paging a table — `offset` + `count()`

`rows()` takes `limit` **and** `offset` (applied after ordering; invalid values coerce to the default), and `ds.count(request, filters)` returns the full matching total so a table can show "showing 1–50 of N":

```python
ds.rows(filters=flt, ordering="-created_at", limit=50, offset=100)  # page 3
ds.count(filters=flt)                                               # → total for paging
ds.rows(filters=flt, limit=None)                                    # whole set (no cap)
```

Over REST the rows route grows `?offset=` and returns an **envelope** `{key, count, total, offset, results}` — `count` is this page's length, `total` is the full matching count. CSV export (`?format=csv`) is the **whole filtered set**, ignoring paging unless you pass `limit`/`offset` explicitly.

### Declared ratio measures

Role inference offers `sum/avg/min/max/count` over numeric columns — but the measures desks chart are usually **ratios** (CSAT % = great/total, abandon rate). Averaging a per-row percentage is the classic wrong answer; a ratio must be recomputed from summed parts. Declare it once:

```python
@dataset("surveys", measures=[
    ("csat_pct", "great", "total", "percent"),   # name, numerator, denominator, fmt
    ("abandon_rate", "abandoned", "offered", "ratio"),
])
def surveys(request=None):
    return Survey.objects.all()
```

`series(dimension, measure="csat_pct")` and `scalar(measure="csat_pct")` compute `sum(numerator) / sum(denominator)` **in the database** per group (`× 100` for `percent`), returning **`None`** (not 0) for an empty denominator — never the average of per-row ratios. Declared measures appear in `schema()["columns"]` with `role: "measure", computed: true`, and the MCP tool advertises them as valid `measure` values. `agg` is ignored for a declared measure (the ratio defines its own aggregation).

### Explicit date ranges

Any date/datetime column accepts half-open bounds — `<col>__gte` / `<col>__lt` (ISO date or datetime) — anywhere filters are accepted (rows/series/scalar, in-process and REST/MCP), alongside the `today/week/month/year` presets. Explicit bounds **win** if both are sent for the same column; unparseable values are ignored. `schema()`'s filter entry for a date column carries `"range": true` so a UI can offer a date-range picker.

```python
ds.rows(filters={"created_at__gte": "2026-07-01", "created_at__lt": "2026-07-08"})  # one week
```

### Bucketed grouping (bands, categories, top-N + Other)

Raw-value grouping is fine until you need "wait time in bands," "top-N queues + Other," or a histogram. Pass `series()` a **dict** dimension instead of a column name — the buckets are the wire grammar (don't invent a second spelling):

```python
# numeric bands — half-open [lo, hi); hi omitted ⇒ open-ended outlier band
ds.series({"field": "wait_s", "buckets": [
    {"key": "fast", "label": "< 30s",  "lo": 0,  "hi": 30},
    {"key": "slow", "label": "30–120s", "lo": 30, "hi": 120},
    {"key": "vslow", "label": "2m+",    "lo": 120, "hi": None},
]})
# categorical: {value} equals, {values:[…]} in-group, {other:true} the complement
ds.series({"field": "queue", "buckets": [
    {"key": "dedicated", "label": "Dedicated", "values": ["8004", "8007"]},
    {"key": "other", "label": "Everything else", "other": True},
]})
# auto — top-N value buckets by volume (+ Other), keyed v:<value>
ds.series({"field": "queue", "auto": {"limit": 8, "label_field": "queue_name"}})
```

Returns `[{key, label, value, lo, hi}]` — `value` is the bucket's **row count** (bucketed grouping is **count-only**; `measure`/`agg` don't apply, that's a future extension). Guarantees:

- **Part-to-whole sums.** With an `{other: true}` bucket the counts sum to the filtered total — no silently dropped rows. Numeric bands are half-open so adjacent bands never double-count.
- **Auto keys are stable.** `auto` buckets derive from the dataset's **unnarrowed** base queryset (the [`queryset()`](#composing-on-a-dataset--the-queryset-seam) seam), so a *filtered* series returns the same buckets, zero-counted where empty — keys never dangle mid-pipeline.

**Drilldown** — the rows behind a clicked bucket — re-apply the *same* bucket condition, so they reconcile with the count by construction:

```python
ds.rows(dimension=dim, bucket="slow")   # exactly the rows in the "slow" band
```

Over REST/MCP: the series/rows routes take the field via `dimension`/`group_by` plus `buckets` (a JSON array — MCP passes it natively; REST URL-encodes it) or `auto=true&auto_limit=&label_field=`; the rows route's `bucket=<key>` is the drilldown.

## Inspecting a dataset to build an interface — the tricks

This is the section that matters for a builder. **`schema()` is your entire source of truth** — pull names, types, roles, and widgets from it and the UI writes itself.

### `schema()` shape

```jsonc
{
  "key": "open_tickets",
  "label": "Open Tickets",
  "columns": [
    {"name": "status",       "label": "Status",   "type": "string",   "role": "dimension"},
    {"name": "created_at",   "label": "Created",   "type": "datetime", "role": "dimension"},
    {"name": "assignee",     "label": "Assignee",  "type": "fk",       "role": "dimension"},
    {"name": "hours_spent",  "label": "Hours",     "type": "float",    "role": "measure"}
  ],
  "filters": [
    {"name": "status",   "label": "Status",  "type": "choice",  "choices": [["","All"],["open","Open"],["blocked","Blocked"]]},
    {"name": "created_at","label": "Created", "type": "choice",  "is_date": true, "choices": [["","All"],["today","Today"],["week","Past 7 days"], "..."]},
    {"name": "assignee", "label": "Assignee","type": "choice",  "choices": [["","All"],["3","Ada"],["7","Grace"], "..."]}
  ]
}
```

### Trick 1 — split pickers by `role`

`role` is the chart-affordance hint. Filter your field pickers by it and each chart type's inputs fall out automatically:

```python
sch = get_dataset(key).schema()
dimensions = [c for c in sch["columns"] if c["role"] == "dimension"]   # categories / axes / group-by
measures   = [c for c in sch["columns"] if c["role"] == "measure"]     # values to aggregate
```

- **Bar / line**: one `dimension` (X) + one `measure` (Y).
- **Pie / donut**: one `dimension` (slices); measure optional (defaults to row count).
- **KPI tile**: one `measure` + an `agg` → call `scalar(measure, agg)` (or the `/scalar/` route). One ungrouped number, computed in the DB — no `dimension`, no client-side summing.
- **Table**: any columns.

Disable a chart type in the UI when the dataset lacks the roles it needs (e.g. grey out bar charts if `measures` is empty) — you know that *before* fetching a single row.

### Trick 2 — build filter widgets straight from `filters`

Don't infer widgets. `schema()["filters"]` already tells you the control to render:

| `type` | Render as | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `choice` (with `choices`) | dropdown / segmented control | Auto-detected from FK targets, `choices=`, or ≤30 distinct values. `choices` is `[[value, label], …]`; the first is usually `["", "All"]` |
| `choice` + `is_date: true` | date-range preset dropdown | Values are `today` / `yesterday` / `week` / `month` / `year` |
| `boolean` | toggle (All / Yes / No) | |
| `text` | free-text input | Matched with `icontains` server-side |

Each filter's `name` is the query key you send back to `rows()` — round-trips exactly.

### Trick 3 — map `type` to formatting

`type` is the raw Django-derived datatype; use it to format cells and pick input controls:

`string` · `integer` · `float` · `decimal` · `date` · `datetime` · `time` · `boolean` · `fk`

e.g. right-align + thousands-separate `integer`/`float`/`decimal`; render `datetime` with the `localtime_tooltip` tag; render `fk` values as a link.

`fk` columns come back as a **bare pk by default**. Pass `expand=` to `rows()` (or `?expand=fk1,fk2` on the REST rows route, mirroring the CRUD API) to get `{"id", "name"}` for those columns instead:

```python
ds.rows(expand=["assignee", "category"], limit=100)   # → assignee: {"id": 3, "name": "Priya"}
```

Unknown or non-FK names in `expand=` are ignored. For **charts**, `series()` resolves an FK dimension's labels to the related object's `str()` automatically (so a bar chart reads `Electrical`, not `2`) — no `expand` needed there.

### Trick 4 — the round-trip is stable, and filters apply everywhere

Every `name` from `schema()` is the same key you pass back — and **`rows()`, `series()` and `scalar()` share one filter contract**. Pass the *same* `filters` dict to all three and the table, the chart, and the KPI tile all reflect the active filters. This is essential for a filter builder: change a filter once, everything updates together.

```python
flt = {"status": "open", "created_at": "week"}
ds.rows(filters=flt, ordering="-created_at", limit=100)         # filtered table
ds.series("assignee", measure="hours_spent", agg="sum", filters=flt)   # filtered chart
ds.scalar(measure="hours_spent", agg="sum", filters=flt)               # filtered KPI
```

Over REST the contract is the same: any non-reserved query param on the rows, `series`, **or** `scalar` route is a filter. So `GET /<key>/series/?dimension=priority&status=open` groups by priority *within* the open rows, and `GET /<key>/scalar/?agg=count&status=open` counts only the open rows. Unknown filter keys are ignored (never a 500).

So a builder can be fully data-driven: read schema → collect user choices keyed by `name` → post the same filter set to whichever endpoint the widget needs. No translation layer.

**The flat-filter invariant (stable across releases).** A `filters` dict is always a **flat, string-keyed `{name: scalar}` mapping** — the serializable query-param shape. This is deliberate and guaranteed: stored slice descriptors, saved dashboard links, and agent calls all round-trip through `urlencode`, so the contract can't quietly become nested. Richer filtering arrives only as **new param spellings** (e.g. a future `created_at__gte=`), never as nested objects replacing existing keys.

### Trick 5 — probe cheaply, fetch lazily

- `list_datasets()` is **metadata only** (no DB, no schema probe) — safe to call on every page load for the picker.
- `schema()` runs a **small** query per categorical column (distinct-value probe) — call it once when a dataset is selected, then cache it for the session.
- `rows()` / `series()` are the only heavy calls — trigger them on an explicit "run / preview," not on every keystroke.

## Computed columns

`type`/`role` are inferred from **real model fields**. A column produced by `.annotate()` isn't a model field, so declare it explicitly — then it flows through `schema()` with the right type and role:

```python
from django.db.models import Count

@dataset("tickets_by_assignee", columns=[("assignee", "fk"), ("ticket_count", "integer")])
def tickets_by_assignee(request=None):
    return (Ticket.objects.values("assignee")
            .annotate(ticket_count=Count("id")))
```

Model-field columns need nothing; only computed ones need the `(name, type)` hint.

Every operation works on a computed dataset: `list_datasets()`, `schema()`, `series()`, `scalar()`, and `rows()`. A `.values().annotate()` queryset yields plain dicts (no model instance), so `rows()` returns those annotated dicts projected onto your declared columns (any extra annotation keys are appended) — no FK `expand` applies to a values-queryset since it's already reduced to scalars.

## Exposing to agents (MCP)

Set `enable_mcp=True` and the dataset becomes a `query_dataset_<key>` tool: the agent passes filter args, gets rows — or passes `group_by` (+ optional `measure`/`agg`) for a `[{label, value}]` series, or `scalar=true` (+ `measure`/`agg`, no `group_by`) for a single KPI number. The filter args apply in **all three** modes (rows, series, scalar), so a grouped or aggregated answer respects the same filters. FK columns come back expanded (`{id, name}`) so the agent reads names, not pks. A site-level `list_datasets` tool lets the agent discover what's queryable. Secure default is `mcp_access="staff"`; widen deliberately. This is the same "declare once, surface everywhere" pattern as `enable_api`/`enable_mcp` on a CRUDView.

## Composing on a dataset — the `queryset()` seam

When a higher layer needs to build *on* a dataset (its own aggregation, annotation, or pagination) rather than consume `rows()`/`series()`, use the public **`queryset()`** method — don't reach into internals:

```python
ds = get_dataset("queued_inbound_calls")
qs = ds.queryset(request, filters={"status": "unanswered"})   # → a plain QuerySet
# you own everything from here: qs.aggregate(...), your own paging, etc.
```

`queryset(request=None, filters=None)` returns the dataset's queryset with the standard filter pipeline applied and **nothing else** — no serialization, limit, ordering, or expand. Same filter contract as `rows()` (unknown keys ignored); per-user scoping via the dataset function's `request` arg happens inside. Guaranteed: `ds.queryset(r, f).count() == len(ds.rows(request=r, filters=f))` for the same filters (unlimited). This is the supported seam for a reporter/BI layer that treats datasets as its source of blessed, filterable scopes.

## When to reach for a dataset vs. a CRUDView

- **Dataset** — read-only, analytical: "a filtered table to slice, chart, or export." No edit/detail pages. Can join/annotate/aggregate; source is any queryset.
- **CRUDView** — the record is a first-class editable thing (admin + REST + detail pages). If you need create/update/delete UI, use a CRUDView; if you only need to *read and shape* rows, use a dataset.

They compose: a dataset can return a queryset over the same model a CRUDView manages.

## Settings & gotchas

- Master switch: `SMALLSTACK_DATASETS_ENABLED` (default on). Off → REST 404s and no MCP tools register; per-dataset `enable_*` become no-ops.
- REST authenticates via **Bearer token OR session** — the same `_authenticate_api_request` path `/api/` uses — so a cross-origin SPA (sending `Authorization: Bearer …`) reaches it directly. Failures return a JSON **401/403**, never a 302 to an HTML login page.
- REST is **staff-only** by default (secure default for an admin data surface): an authenticated non-staff caller gets a JSON 403. For a non-staff end-user builder, build your own view over `get_dataset(key)` with the right auth + tenancy scoping — see [`building-a-user-facing-site.md`](building-a-user-facing-site.md). Scope per-user data inside the dataset function via its `request` arg.
- `series()`/`scalar()` validate `dimension`/`measure` against the dataset's columns: an unknown name raises `ValueError` in-process and returns a JSON **400** over REST (not a 500). `rows()` still silently ignores unknown ordering/filter/expand keys.
- **CSV export**: the rows route honours `?format=csv` — same rows + filters, streamed as a `text/csv` attachment (`<key>.csv`) with the schema columns as the header (expanded FK cells render as the name). That's the "export screen" path; no extra config.
- `filterable` defaults to **all columns**. Numeric columns filter by exact match; text columns with many distinct values fall back to substring (`icontains`); low-cardinality columns become dropdowns.
- Base ships **no datasets** — the app is the seam only. Declare yours in an app's `datasets.py`.

## Anti-patterns

1. **Hard-coding column lists in the builder** — read `schema()["columns"]` instead; the whole design is that the UI adapts to any dataset.
2. **Inferring filter widgets from `type`** — use `schema()["filters"]`, which already resolved FK/choice/date/boolean widgets (and ran the categorical detection for you).
3. **Calling `schema()` on every render** — cache it per selected dataset; it does per-column distinct probes.
4. **Fetching rows to compute a total** — use `scalar(measure, agg)` for a single KPI number, or `series(dimension, measure, agg)` for a per-group rollup; both aggregate in the database, not in Python. (Don't sum `series` buckets client-side to get one number — that's what `scalar()` is for.)
5. **Forgetting `columns=` for annotations** — an annotated column with no hint types as `string`/`dimension` and won't offer as a measure.
