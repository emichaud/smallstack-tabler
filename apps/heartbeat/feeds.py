"""Status RSS/Atom feed — the reference integration for :mod:`apps.feeds`.

Publishes the public status page's human-readable events — service **incidents**
and scheduled **maintenance windows** — so anyone can subscribe to status
instead of polling the page. Public (``SearchAccess.ANONYMOUS``), matching the
public ``/status/`` page, and registered from ``HeartbeatConfig.ready()``.

This is the worked example of a *custom* feed provider (as opposed to the
``enable_rss`` one-liner): it merges two models and derives incidents, which a
raw per-model dump can't express. Build your own curated feed the same way —
subclass :class:`apps.feeds.Feed`, implement :meth:`items`, ``register_feed``.
