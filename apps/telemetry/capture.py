"""Runtime control over how much gets captured to the database.

Production captures WARNING and above, so the table stays small and the write
volume stays negligible. When you need detail out of a live deployment you open
a *capture window* — "DEBUG for 15 minutes" — reproduce the problem, and the
window closes itself.

Two levels have to move for that to work, and missing the second one is the
usual reason "I turned on DEBUG and saw nothing":

1. the **handler** level — whether the database handler stores a record it is
   given; and
2. the **logger** levels — whether the record is created and dispatched to
   handlers at all. ``apps`` sits at INFO in production, so a ``logger.debug()``
   is discarded before any handler is consulted.

The window lives in the database rather than in process memory so it applies to
every worker and every container — each process polls it on its own writer
thread and applies the change locally.
