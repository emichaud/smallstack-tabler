"""Register search MCP tools.

For every CRUDView with ``enable_search = True``, register a
``search_<plural>(query, limit)`` tool with the MCP server. Also
register a cross-model ``search_all(query, limit_per_model)`` tool so
Claude can find anything matching across the whole site.

Tools follow the same async-handler shape as the existing factory tools
(see ``apps/mcp/factory.py``). The MCP server's TOOL_REGISTRY is a
process-level dict, so we just call ``tool(...)`` at startup time from
``SearchConfig.ready()``.

If ``apps.mcp`` isn't installed (downstream project chose to disable
MCP), the import is guarded and we silently skip — the search backend
still works for HTML + REST.

Security
--------
Every search MCP handler now pulls the calling token's user from the
MCP context (``current_context().user``) and feeds it to the registry's
access gate. Before v0.11.9 the handlers called ``backend.query()`` /
``search_all()`` directly with no user, which bypassed the
``search_access`` gate that the HTTP surface enforced — a non-staff
caller with a readonly token could pull rows from a STAFF-tier view
(the v0.11.8 round-2 audit §3.3 ``search_users`` leak). The fix mirrors
the web search path: STAFF-tier views deny non-staff callers, AUTH-tier
views accept any authenticated, ANONYMOUS-tier always passes, and
``search_visibility`` callbacks still scope rows per user.

Help docs remain always-visible (intentionally — they are
documentation).
