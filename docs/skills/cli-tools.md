# CLI tools — the agent's index

When the user asks Claude (or any agent) to do something operational — diagnose, verify, mint, backup, screenshot, smoke-test, deploy — SmallStack almost always already has a tool for it. **Don't reinvent**. Use this file as your decision tree.

For the full reference with every flag, see [`apps/smallstack/docs/cli-reference.md`](../../apps/smallstack/docs/cli-reference.md).

## How this file is organized

Two tables: a **task → tool map** (the most common lookups) and a **tool → docs map** (when the user asked for a specific tool and you need to know which skill explains it).

---

## Task → tool

| If the user wants to… | Reach for |
|---|---|
| **set up SmallStack from scratch** | `make setup` (one-time) |
| **inspect / query / edit any model from the shell** | `sc ls <model> -q …` · `sc get <model> <pk>` · `sc new/set/rm` (the `sc` CLI — audited + validated like REST/MCP; prefer over `manage.py shell` snippets). See [`sc-cli.md`](sc-cli.md) |
| discover **what models / commands exist** | `sc ls` (models) · `sc commands` (management commands, grouped) |
| **health-check the whole framework** at once | `sc doctor all` (api + mcp + search + webhook) |
| start the dev server | `make run` (port 8005; `PORT=N make run` to change) |
| run tests | `make test` (full) or `uv run pytest -k <name>` (one) |
| lint | `make lint` (ruff + mypy) / `make lint-fix` (ruff autofix) |
| check that the **REST API is healthy** | `uv run python manage.py api_doctor` |
| understand **what API endpoints exist** | `uv run python manage.py api_doctor --explain` |
| validate **OpenAPI spec is still 3.0.3-compliant** | `uv run python manage.py api_doctor` → look at `OpenAPI validity` row |
| smoke-test the API against a **running** server | `make api-test` (= `manage.py api_smoke`) |
| check that **MCP is healthy** | `uv run python manage.py mcp_doctor` (or `make mcp-doctor`) |
| see **what MCP tools Claude sees** | `uv run python manage.py mcp_doctor --explain` |
| smoke-test MCP against a running server | `make mcp-test` (= `manage.py mcp_smoke`) |
| check that **webhooks are healthy** | `uv run python manage.py webhook_doctor` (or `sc doctor webhook`) |
| **report on webhook deliveries / get status** | `sc webhook status` · `sc webhook list` · `sc webhook deliveries [--status dead]` |
| **create an outbound webhook endpoint** | `sc new webhook --name … --target_url … --event_filter '[…]' --enabled=true --user admin` |
| **test / replay a webhook** | `sc webhook test <endpoint>` · `sc webhook replay <delivery_id>` |
| **replay ALL dead deliveries** (dead-letter recovery after an outage) | `sc webhook replay --status dead [--endpoint … --since … --limit …]` |
| **link two SmallStacks** (loop-safe S2S; event source ↔ action target) | `sc webhook pair --target <peer-inbound-url>` (emits the mirror command to run on the peer; `--one-way`, `--verify`) |
| **drive the webhook retry tick** (cron) | `uv run python manage.py run_due_deliveries` (or `POST /webhooks/tick/` on localhost) |
| **mint an API token** (CLI / CI / deploy) | `uv run python manage.py create_api_token <user> --access-level <level>` |
| mint a dev superuser | `make superuser` (= `manage.py create_dev_superuser`) |
| **back up the SQLite database** | `make backup` (= `manage.py backup_db [--keep N]`) |
| trim the activity log | `uv run python manage.py prune_activity` |
| **read logs from a deployment you can't shell into** | Open **`/smallstack/logs/`** (staff-only viewer: level/logger/search filters, expandable tracebacks) |
| **see every log line from one request** | `/smallstack/logs/?request_id=<X-Request-ID>` — or click the `logs` link on the request in `/smallstack/activity/requests/` |
| **capture DEBUG from a live deployment, temporarily** | `uv run python manage.py log_capture start --level DEBUG --minutes 15` (auto-closes) |
| close a capture window early | `uv run python manage.py log_capture stop` |
| trim captured log records | `uv run python manage.py prune_logs [--keep-days N --max-rows N]` |
| run a single **heartbeat / uptime** check | `uv run python manage.py heartbeat` |
| reset the uptime epoch after a restore | `uv run python manage.py heartbeat --reset-epoch --reset-note "..."` |
| **test the task queue + heartbeat locally** (worker + heartbeat in one process) | `make services` (= `./utils/dev_services.sh`; `ARGS="--interval 5 --smoke"` for a fast end-to-end check) |
| **open a maintenance window** (planned downtime, SLA-excluded) | `uv run python manage.py maintenance open --minutes N --title "..."` |
| close / list maintenance windows | `uv run python manage.py maintenance close` / `... maintenance list` |
| **SLA-exclude the container swap on deploy** | set `MAINTENANCE_ON_DEPLOY=true` in `.kamal/secrets` (the deploy hooks open/close it) |
| take an **authenticated screenshot** | `make screenshot-auth` → `shot-scraper <url> --auth /tmp/auth.json -o /tmp/out.png` |
| take an unauthenticated screenshot | `shot-scraper <url> -o /tmp/out.png --width 1440 --wait 1500` |
| migrate the database | `make migrate` |
| create new migrations after model edits | `make migrations` |
| open `shell_plus` | `make shell` |
| **deploy to production** | `make deploy` (Kamal) |
| tail prod logs | `make logs` |
| build/start/stop Docker | `make docker-up` / `make docker-down` |
| see every Make target | `make help` (or just `make`) |
| see every `manage.py` command | `uv run python manage.py --help` |
| see help for a single command | `uv run python manage.py <cmd> --help` |

## Failure-mode → tool

When the user reports a problem, **start at the matching doctor**.

| Symptom | First tool | Skill doc |
|---|---|---|
| "Swagger UI is empty" | `api_doctor` → check `API registry` row | [`api-doctor.md`](api-doctor.md) |
| "My new CRUDView isn't in `/api/`" | `api_doctor` → check `Orphan files` row | [`api-doctor.md`](api-doctor.md) |
| "OpenAPI spec is broken" | `api_doctor` → `OpenAPI validity` row | [`api-doctor.md`](api-doctor.md) |
| "Claude Desktop can't see my tools" | `mcp_doctor` → check `Server registry` row | [`mcp/debug-mcp-failure.md`](mcp/debug-mcp-failure.md) |
| "MCP returns 404" | `mcp_doctor` → check `URL conf` row | [`mcp/debug-mcp-failure.md`](mcp/debug-mcp-failure.md) |
| "Suspicious traffic on `/api/*`" | Open `/smallstack/api/activity/` (Threat panel) | [`api-doctor.md`](api-doctor.md) |
| "Suspicious MCP calls" | Open `/smallstack/mcp/activity/` | [`mcp/mcp-admin-pages.md`](mcp/mcp-admin-pages.md) |
| "Server is up but `/status/` says down" | `manage.py heartbeat` | (Heartbeat docs) |
| "My webhook isn't firing" | `webhook_doctor` → check `Outbound registry` (is `enable_webhooks` set?) + `Endpoint filters` (empty = inert) rows | [`webhooks.md`](webhooks.md) |
| "Webhook deliveries are stuck retrying" | `webhook_doctor` → `Delivery tick` row (the retry tick isn't running) | [`webhooks.md`](webhooks.md) |
| "Inbound webhook returns 401 / isn't handled" | `webhook_doctor` → `Inbound handlers` row; check the receiver's `secret` + `@webhook_handler` slug | [`webhooks.md`](webhooks.md) |
| "Webhook `resource.url` is null / S2S dedupe not working" | `webhook_doctor` → `Webhook origin` row (WARN when origin unresolved — set `SITE_URL`/`SMALLSTACK_WEBHOOK_ORIGIN`) | [`webhooks.md`](webhooks.md) |
| "Is the task queue actually draining locally?" | `make services ARGS="--smoke"` (watch the worker drain it) | [`background-tasks.md`](background-tasks.md) |
| "Deploy downtime is counting against my SLA" | open a maintenance window (`manage.py maintenance`) or enable `MAINTENANCE_ON_DEPLOY` | [`status-monitors.md`](status-monitors.md) |
| "DB file is huge" | `manage.py prune_activity` **and** `manage.py prune_logs`, then `make backup --keep 7` | — |
| "I can't reach the logs — no shell on the container" | `log_capture status`; records are in the DB, browsable in admin | [`logging-audit.md`](logging-audit.md) |
| "I turned on DEBUG and still see nothing" | the *logger* level gates before any handler — check `TELEMETRY_CAPTURE_LOGGERS` covers your logger | [`logging-audit.md`](logging-audit.md) |
| "log_capture status says dropped > 0" | the queue overflowed; raise `TELEMETRY_LOG_QUEUE_SIZE` or capture at a higher level | [`logging-audit.md`](logging-audit.md) |

## Tool → docs

When the user names a specific tool, here's the skill (or reference doc) that explains it.

| Tool | Primary doc |
|---|---|
| `api_doctor` | [`api-doctor.md`](api-doctor.md) |
| `mcp_doctor` | [`mcp/verify-mcp.md`](mcp/verify-mcp.md), [`mcp/debug-mcp-failure.md`](mcp/debug-mcp-failure.md) |
| `api_smoke` / `make api-test` | [`api-doctor.md`](api-doctor.md) |
| `mcp_smoke` / `make mcp-test` | [`mcp/verify-mcp.md`](mcp/verify-mcp.md) |
| `create_api_token` | [`manage-api-tokens.md`](manage-api-tokens.md) |
| `backup_db` / `make backup` | (DB backup doc — `apps/smallstack/docs/database-backups.md`) |
| `screenshot_auth` + `shot-scraper` | [`screenshot-workflow.md`](screenshot-workflow.md) |
| `heartbeat` | (Heartbeat doc — `apps/smallstack/docs/uptime-monitoring.md`) |
| `prune_activity` | [`activity-tracking.md`](activity-tracking.md) |
| `log_capture` / `prune_logs` | [`logging-audit.md`](logging-audit.md) |
| `make run` / `make test` / `make lint` | [`development-workflow.md`](development-workflow.md) |
| `make deploy` | [`kamal-deployment.md`](kamal-deployment.md) |
| `make docker-up` | [`docker-deployment.md`](docker-deployment.md) |

## How to use this in a session

1. The user asks "can you check if the API is set up right?" → look at the **Task → tool** table → row "check that the REST API is healthy" → run `uv run python manage.py api_doctor` → report.
2. The user says "Claude.ai can't see my MCP tools" → look at **Failure-mode → tool** → row "Claude Desktop can't see my tools" → run `mcp_doctor`, read the `Server registry` row, follow the linked skill if more depth needed.
3. The user names a tool you don't recognize → look at **Tool → docs** → read the linked skill → answer.

**Don't:**
- Write a bash one-liner for a task that has a `make` target.
- Spawn a subagent to "find a way to back up the DB" — `make backup` exists.
- Hand-roll an OpenAPI validation script — `api_doctor --check-only` does it.
- Use raw `python` — always `uv run python`. The project's venv lives at `.venv/` and `uv run` activates it transparently.

## When the user is vibe-coding

If the user is building a new feature with AI assistance and asks for "the right way" to do something operational, default to:

1. Check `cli-reference.md` for a built-in tool. If it exists, use it — don't write a script.
2. If no tool exists but a related skill mentions a pattern (e.g., `dashboard-widgets.md` for adding a widget), follow that pattern rather than inventing.
3. Only write new code when (1) and (2) come up empty.

This file is the entry point. When in doubt, **read this first, then the specific skill, then the reference**.
